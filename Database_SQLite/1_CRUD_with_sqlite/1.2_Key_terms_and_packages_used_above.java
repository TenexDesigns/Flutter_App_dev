In the code example, there are several elements and functions used that come from various packages and libraries. Let me clarify what these components are:

1. `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`: This function is part of the `path_provider` package. It's used to retrieve the path to the directory where your app can store data files that are private to the application, such as databases. This function is typically used to determine the location for creating or opening a local SQLite database.

2. `Database`: The `Database` class is part of the `sqflite` package, which is a popular Flutter plugin for working with SQLite databases. This class represents a connection to a SQLite database and provides methods for performing operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

3. `openDatabase`: This function is used to open a SQLite database. It's a part of the `sqflite` package and is used to create or open an SQLite database file. It takes the path to the database file, a version number, and an `onCreate` callback that is called if the database needs to be created.

4. `_database.insert`: This is a method provided by the `Database` class from the `sqflite` package. It is used to insert records into a SQLite database. In the code, it's used to insert a new book record into the "books" table.

5. Other Methods: The `Database` class from the `sqflite` package provides various methods for database operations like querying, updating, deleting, and transaction management. Some other commonly used methods include `query`, `update`, `delete`, and `transaction`.

The example demonstrates how to open a SQLite database, create a table, insert data, and retrieve records from it using the `sqflite` package. The functions and methods you see in the code are specific to working with SQLite databases in Flutter, and they are not part of the core Dart language.

For more detailed information about the available methods and how to use the `sqflite` package, you can refer to the official documentation: [sqflite package](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite). This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on using SQLite databases in Flutter.
