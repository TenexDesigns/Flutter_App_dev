The `_addBook` function is performing an asynchronous operation (`insertBook`), so it should be marked as `async`. This allows you to use the `await` keyword inside the function. Here's how you can modify your `_addBook` function:

```dart
void _addBook() async {
  if (_formKey.currentState!.validate()) {
    // Form is valid, perform submission logic here
    String name = _nameController.text;
    int pages = int.parse(_pagesController.text);
    print("The name is $name, and my email is $pages");

    final newBook = Book(title: name, pages: pages);
    await widget.bookController.insertBook(newBook);  // Use GetX controller for the operation

    _pagesController.clear();
    _nameController.clear();

    // Show a snackbar for successful completion
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('Form submitted successfully')),
    );
  }
}
```

In this updated code, I've added the `async` keyword to the function definition and used `widget.bookController` to access the `BookController` instance. Also, I've used `int.parse` to convert the text from the pages controller to an integer.

Regarding the `dispose` method, it's important to call `dispose` on your `TextEditingController` instances when you're done with them to free up resources. If you're using GetX for state management, you might not need to manually dispose of your controllers if they're being managed by GetX. However, if you're manually creating and managing your controllers, you should still dispose of them to avoid memory leaks.
