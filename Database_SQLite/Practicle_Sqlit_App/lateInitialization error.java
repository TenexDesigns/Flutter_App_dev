The error "lateInitialization error: Field _database@29096455 has not been initialized" is occurring because the `_database` field in your `DatabaseHelper` class is being accessed before it has been initialized. This is likely because you're trying to perform a database operation before the `open()` method has completed.

To fix this, you need to ensure that the `open()` method has completed before performing any database operations. You can do this by awaiting the `open()` method in the `onInit()` method of your `BookController` class:

```dart
// In BookController.dart
@override
void onInit() async {
  await dbHelper.open();
  _refreshBookList();
  super.onInit();
}
```

Note that you need to mark the `onInit()` method as `async` and use the `await` keyword before `dbHelper.open()` to wait for it to complete.

As for the "E/OpenGLRenderer(26947): fbcNotifyFrameComplete error: undefined symbol: fbcNotifyFrameComplete" error, this is a known issue with the Android emulator and doesn't affect the functionality of your app. You can safely ignore this error. If you want to get rid of the error message, you can try updating your Android emulator to the latest version or testing your app on a physical device.
