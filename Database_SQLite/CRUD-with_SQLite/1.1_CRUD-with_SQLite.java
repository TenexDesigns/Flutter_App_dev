**SQLite in Flutter and the sqflite plugin**

SQLite is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that is embedded in many applications. It is known for its small size, fast performance, and reliability.

The sqflite plugin is a Flutter plugin that allows you to use SQLite databases in your Flutter apps.

**To perform CRUD operations with SQLite in Flutter, you will need to:**

1. Add the sqflite plugin to your pubspec.yaml file.
2. Create a model class for each type of data that you want to store in the database.
3. Create a database helper class to manage the database connection and CRUD operations.
4. Connect the database to your UI.

**Create a model class**

A model class is a Dart class that represents a row in the database. The model class should have properties for each column in the table.

For example, if you have a table called `users` with the columns `id`, `name`, and `email`, you would create a model class called `User` with the following properties:

```dart
class User {
  int id;
  String name;
  String email;

  User({this.id, this.name, this.email});
}
```

**Create a database helper class**

The database helper class is responsible for managing the database connection and CRUD operations.

To create a database helper class, you will need to extend the `DatabaseHelper` class from the sqflite plugin.

The `DatabaseHelper` class provides a number of methods for performing CRUD operations, such as `insert()`, `query()`, `update()`, and `delete()`.

For example, the following code shows how to insert a new user into the `users` table:

```dart
final database = DatabaseHelper();

// Insert a new user into the database.
await database.insert(User(name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com'));
```

**Connect the database to your UI**

To connect the database to your UI, you can use the `FutureBuilder` widget. The `FutureBuilder` widget allows you to wait for the result of an asynchronous operation, such as a database query.

For example, the following code shows how to use the `FutureBuilder` widget to display a list of all users in the `users` table:

```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  final database = DatabaseHelper();

  Future<List<User>> getUsers() async {
    // Perform a database query to get all users.
    final users = await database.query(User());

    return users;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('My App'),
      ),
      body: FutureBuilder<List<User>>(
        future: getUsers(),
        builder: (context, snapshot) {
          if (snapshot.hasData) {
            return ListView.builder(
              itemCount: snapshot.data!.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final user = snapshot.data![index];

                return Text(user.name);
              },
            );
          } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
            return Text('${snapshot.error}');
          } else {
            return CircularProgressIndicator();
          }
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**How do all this tie together**

The sqflite plugin allows you to use SQLite databases in your Flutter apps. To perform CRUD operations with SQLite in Flutter, you need to create a model class for each type of data that you want to store in the database, create a database helper class to manage the database connection and CRUD operations, and connect the database to your UI.

By following these steps, you can use SQLite to store and manage data in your Flutter apps.
