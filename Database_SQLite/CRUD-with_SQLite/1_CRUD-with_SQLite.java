Using SQLite in Flutter involves several steps, including creating model classes, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, setting up a database helper, and connecting the database to the UI. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine used for mobile and desktop applications. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use SQLite in Flutter:

1. **Import the SQLite Plugin:**
   To use SQLite in your Flutter app, you need to add the `sqflite` plugin to your `pubspec.yaml` file. This plugin provides an easy way to work with SQLite databases in Flutter.

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     sqflite: ^2.0.0
     path: ^<latest_version>
   ```

   Don't forget to run `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies.

2. **Create a Model Class:**
   Define a model class to represent the data you want to store in the database. This class should have properties that match the database table's columns. For example:

   ```dart
   class Task {
     int id;
     String title;
     bool isDone;

     Task({this.id, this.title, this.isDone});
   }
   ```

3. **Create a Database Helper:**
   Create a database helper class that handles the SQLite database operations. This class should provide methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. Here's a simplified example:

   ```dart
   import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';
   import 'package:path/path.dart';

   class DatabaseHelper {
     Database _database;

     Future<void> initDatabase() async {
       if (_database == null) {
         _database = await openDatabase(
           join(await getDatabasesPath(), 'tasks_database.db'),
           onCreate: (db, version) {
             return db.execute(
               'CREATE TABLE tasks(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, title TEXT, isDone INTEGER)',
             );
           },
           version: 1,
         );
       }
     }

     Future<int> insertTask(Task task) async {
       await initDatabase();
       return await _database.insert('tasks', task.toMap());
     }

     Future<List<Task>> getTasks() async {
       await initDatabase();
       final List<Map<String, dynamic>> maps = await _database.query('tasks');
       return List.generate(maps.length, (i) {
         return Task(
           id: maps[i]['id'],
           title: maps[i]['title'],
           isDone: maps[i]['isDone'] == 1,
         );
       });
     }

     // Implement update and delete methods here
   }
   ```

4. **Connect Database to UI:**
   In your Flutter app, you can use the database helper to perform CRUD operations. For example, to insert a new task:

   ```dart
   final dbHelper = DatabaseHelper();
   final newTask = Task(title: 'Buy groceries', isDone: false);
   final insertedId = await dbHelper.insertTask(newTask);
   ```

   To retrieve tasks and display them in the UI:

   ```dart
   final dbHelper = DatabaseHelper();
   final tasks = await dbHelper.getTasks();
   ```

5. **Update and Delete Records:**
   Implement update and delete methods in the database helper class similar to the insert and query methods. These methods should use the `update` and `delete` SQL commands, respectively.

   ```dart
   Future<int> updateTask(Task task) async {
     await initDatabase();
     return await _database.update(
       'tasks',
       task.toMap(),
       where: 'id = ?',
       whereArgs: [task.id],
     );
   }

   Future<int> deleteTask(int taskId) async {
     await initDatabase();
     return await _database.delete(
       'tasks',
       where: 'id = ?',
       whereArgs: [taskId],
     );
   }
   ```

6. **Tie Everything Together:**
   Finally, integrate the database helper methods with your app's UI. Display tasks, handle user input, and update the database accordingly.

This is a basic overview of how to use SQLite in Flutter. You can expand on this foundation to create more complex database structures and operations as needed for your app. Additionally, you may want to use state management solutions like Provider or Riverpod to efficiently manage and update UI components based on database changes.
