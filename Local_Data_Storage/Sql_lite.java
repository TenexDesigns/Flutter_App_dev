SQLite is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that is embedded in mobile devices. It is a lightweight, high-performance database that is ideal for storing data on mobile devices.

To use SQLite in Flutter, you can use the sqflite package. This package provides a Dart API for interacting with SQLite databases.

To use the sqflite package, you first need to add it to your Flutter project. You can do this by adding the following line to your pubspec.yaml file:

dependencies:
  sqflite: ^2.0.0
Once you have added the package to your project, you can import it into your code:

Dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

To create a database, you can use the openDatabase() function. This function takes the path to the database file as an argument and returns a Future of a Database object.

The Database object represents the database and provides a number of methods for interacting with it, such as creating tables, inserting data, and querying data.

Here is a simple code sample for how to create a database and insert data into it:

Dart
Future<void> main() async {
  // Create a database.
  final database = await openDatabase('my_database.db');

  // Create a table.
  await database.execute('CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)');

  // Insert data into the table.
  await database.insert('users', {'name': 'John Doe'});

  // Close the database.
  await database.close();
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
To query data from the database, you can use the query() function. This function takes the name of the table to query and a list of columns to return as arguments and returns a Future of a list of Map objects.

Each Map object in the list represents a row in the table.

Here is a simple code sample for how to query data from the database:

Dart
Future<void> main() async {
  // Create a database.
  final database = await openDatabase('my_database.db');

  // Query the users table for all users.
  final users = await database.query('users');

  // Print the names of all users.
  for (final user in users) {
    print(user['name']);
  }

  // Close the database.
  await database.close();
}

You can use SQLite to store any type of data on your mobile device, including:

User data, such as names, email addresses, and passwords.
Application settings, such as the user's preferred language or theme.
Game data, such as the player's score or inventory.
Any other type of data that you need to store on your mobile device.
SQLite is a powerful and versatile database management system that can be used to store a wide variety of data on mobile devices. It is a good choice for both simple and complex data storage needs.
