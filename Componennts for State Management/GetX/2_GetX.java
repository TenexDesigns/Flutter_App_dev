GetX is a state management, dependency injection, and route management solution for Flutter applications. It provides a quick and practical way to manage both simple and complex states in your Flutter application. It's known for its simplicity, performance, and minimalistic API [Source 0](https://pub.dev/packages/get).

Here are the main components involved in GetX:

- **`GetBuilder`**: A simple state manager that triggers a rebuild on a widget whenever `update()` is called.

- **`GetX` and `Obx`**: Reactive state managers that automatically update the UI when the values they are listening to change.

- **`Get.put`, `Get.lazyPut`, `Get.find`, `Get.create`**: Methods for dependency injection, allowing you to easily create and retrieve instances of your classes.

Here's an example of how to use GetX for state management:

First, define a controller:

```dart
class CounterController extends GetxController {
  var count = 0.obs;

  void increment() {
    count.value++;
  }
}
```

In this example, `count` is an observable integer. Whenever `count` changes, all widgets that are using `count` will be updated.

Then, use `GetBuilder` or `Obx` to listen to changes:

```dart
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  final CounterController counterController = Get.put(CounterController());

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Counter')),
      body: Center(
        child: Obx(() => Text('Clicked: ${counterController.count}')),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
        onPressed: () {
          counterController.increment();
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we use `Get.put` to create an instance of `CounterController` and make it available for all children of `HomePage`. Then, we use `Obx` to listen to changes in `count` and update the `Text` widget whenever `count` changes. The `FloatingActionButton` calls `increment()` to increment the counter.

You can use GetX in various places in your Flutter application. It is particularly useful when you need to share state between different parts of your app, or when you have complex business logic that you want to keep separate from the UI [Source 0](https://pub.dev/packages/get), [Source 1](https://www.filledstacks.com/post/getx-controller-structure-and-state-management/), [Source 2](https://blog.logrocket.com/flutter-state-management-with-getx/), [Source 3](https://medium.com/swlh/flutter-state-management-with-getx-1f220b82e6a1).
