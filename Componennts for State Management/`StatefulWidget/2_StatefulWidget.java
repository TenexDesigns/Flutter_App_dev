The `StatefulWidget` in Flutter is a widget that can change over time. This means that it can be redrawn on the screen with different data or configuration. It's used when the part of the user interface you are describing can change dynamically.

Here are the important properties of the `StatefulWidget`:

- **`createState`**: This is a method that you need to override when you extend `StatefulWidget`. It should return an instance of a class that extends `State`. This is where you put your mutable data and your `build` method.

Here's an example of how to use the `StatefulWidget`:

```dart
class MyStatefulWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  MyStatefulWidget({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _MyStatefulWidgetState createState() => _MyStatefulWidgetState();
}

class _MyStatefulWidgetState extends State<MyStatefulWidget> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Stateful Widget Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a `StatefulWidget` that displays a counter. The counter starts at 0 and increments each time the user presses the floating action button. The `setState` method is called to tell the Flutter framework that something has changed and the widget needs to be redrawn.

You can use the `StatefulWidget` in various places in your Flutter application. It is commonly used when you need to maintain mutable state that can change over time or when user input is received.
