**StatefulWidget:**

A StatefulWidget is a widget that can rebuild when its internal state changes. It is a good choice for widgets that need to display dynamic data or respond to user interactions.

**Properties**

StatefulWidgets have two properties that are not found on StatelessWidgets:

* **createState:** This property is used to create a State object for the widget. The State object is responsible for maintaining the widget's state and rebuilding the widget when the state changes.
* **state:** This property contains the State object for the widget.

**How to use the StatefulWidget widget**

To use a StatefulWidget, you simply need to create a new subclass of StatefulWidget and implement the createState() method. The createState() method should return a new instance of the State class for the widget.

The State class is responsible for maintaining the widget's state and rebuilding the widget when the state changes. To rebuild the widget, the State class should call the setState() method.

**Where to use the StatefulWidget widget**

StatefulWidgets can be used in many different places in your Flutter app. For example, you can use them to:

* Display dynamic data, such as a list of items or a user's profile.
* Respond to user interactions, such as button presses or text input.
* Implement animations.

**Code samples**

Here is a simple code sample for a StatefulWidget:

```dart
class MyStatefulWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<MyStatefulWidget> createState() => _MyStatefulWidgetState();
}

class _MyStatefulWidgetState extends State<MyStatefulWidget> {
  int counter = 0;

  void incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text('Counter: $counter');
  }
}
```

This StatefulWidget has a single state variable, called `counter`. The `incrementCounter()` method is used to increment the `counter` state variable. When the `incrementCounter()` method is called, the `setState()` method is used to tell the framework that the widget's state has changed. This causes the widget to rebuild.

The `build()` method is used to build the widget's UI. In this case, the `build()` method simply displays the current value of the `counter` state variable.

To use the `MyStatefulWidget` class, you would simply add it to your app's widget tree. For example:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return MyStatefulWidget();
}
```

When the user taps the button, the `incrementCounter()` method will be called, which will increment the `counter` state variable and cause the widget to rebuild. This will update the text displayed on the screen to show the new value of the `counter` state variable.

StatefulWidgets are a powerful tool that can be used to create dynamic and interactive Flutter apps.
