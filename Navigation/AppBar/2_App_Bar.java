The `AppBar` widget is a widget that is used to create the app bar at the top of a screen in a Flutter app. It is typically used to display the title of the app, the navigation buttons, and other actions.

To use the `AppBar` widget, you simply need to add it to the top of your widget tree. The `AppBar` widget will automatically position itself at the top of the screen.

Here is a simple Flutter app that uses the `AppBar` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('MyApp'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('This is my app!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This app has a simple app bar that displays the title "MyApp".
