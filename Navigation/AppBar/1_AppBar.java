In Flutter, the `AppBar` widget is used to create a navigation bar at the top of the screen. It provides a consistent and customizable way to display the title, actions, and other elements in the app bar.

Here's how you can use the `AppBar` widget with code samples:

1. Basic Usage:
   - To use the `AppBar` widget, you typically include it as the `appBar` property of a `Scaffold` widget.
   - The `AppBar` widget takes various properties to customize its appearance and behavior.

   ```dart
   Scaffold(
     appBar: AppBar(
       title: Text('My App'),
     ),
     body: Container(
       // Your app content goes here
     ),
   )
   ```

   In the above example, we create a basic `AppBar` with a title of "My App". The `AppBar` is included in the `Scaffold` widget, which provides the overall structure for the screen.

2. Customization:
   - The `AppBar` widget provides several properties to customize its appearance and behavior.
   - Some commonly used properties include:
     - `title`: The title of the app bar, typically a `Text` widget.
     - `actions`: A list of widgets to display as actions in the app bar, such as buttons or icons.
     - `leading`: A widget to display as the leading element in the app bar, typically a back button or an icon.
     - `backgroundColor`: The background color of the app bar.
     - `elevation`: The elevation of the app bar, which controls the shadow effect.
     - `brightness`: The brightness of the app bar, which affects the color of the status bar icons.

   ```dart
   AppBar(
     title: Text('My App'),
     actions: [
       IconButton(
         icon: Icon(Icons.search),
         onPressed: () {
           // Perform search action
         },
       ),
       IconButton(
         icon: Icon(Icons.settings),
         onPressed: () {
           // Perform settings action
         },
       ),
     ],
     backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
     elevation: 4.0,
     brightness: Brightness.dark,
   )
   ```

   In the above example, we customize the `AppBar` by adding two `IconButton` widgets as actions, setting the background color to blue, the elevation to 4.0, and the brightness to dark.

The `AppBar` widget is commonly used in Flutter apps to provide a consistent navigation bar at the top of the screen. It helps in organizing the app's UI and provides easy access to common actions or navigation elements.

The `AppBar` widget has various other properties that you can explore in the Flutter documentation, such as `centerTitle` to center the title, `automaticallyImplyLeading` to automatically show a back button, and more.
