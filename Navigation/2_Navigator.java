The `Navigator` widget in Flutter is used for managing navigation within an app. It allows you to push and pop routes, which represent different screens or pages in your app. Here's how you can use the `Navigator` widget with code samples:

1. Pushing a Route:
   - To navigate to a new screen, you can use the `Navigator.push()` method. This method takes a `BuildContext` and a `Route` as parameters.
   - The `BuildContext` is typically obtained from the `BuildContext` of the current widget.
   - The `Route` represents the screen you want to navigate to and can be a `MaterialPageRoute` or a custom route.

   ```dart
   Navigator.push(
     context,
     MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen()),
   );
   ```

   In the above example, we use `MaterialPageRoute` to push the `SecondScreen` onto the navigation stack. This will navigate to the `SecondScreen` when the method is called.

2. Popping a Route:
   - To go back to the previous screen, you can use the `Navigator.pop()` method. This method takes a `BuildContext` as a parameter.
   - The `BuildContext` is typically obtained from the `BuildContext` of the current widget.

   ```dart
   Navigator.pop(context);
   ```

   In the above example, calling `Navigator.pop(context)` will navigate back to the previous screen.

3. Passing Data:
   - You can also pass data between screens using the `Navigator.push()` method.
   - Pass the data as arguments to the constructor of the destination screen.

   ```dart
   Navigator.push(
     context,
     MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondScreen(data: 'Hello')),
   );
   ```

   In the above example, we pass the string `'Hello'` to the `SecondScreen` as data.

4. Named Routes:
   - Instead of using the `MaterialPageRoute`, you can define named routes in your app's `MaterialApp` widget.
   - This allows you to navigate to screens using a predefined name instead of creating a new `MaterialPageRoute` each time.

   ```dart
   MaterialApp(
     routes: {
       '/second': (context) => SecondScreen(),
     },
   )
   ```

   In the above example, we define a named route `/second` that navigates to the `SecondScreen`.

   ```dart
   Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/second');
   ```

   To navigate to the `SecondScreen` using the named route, you can use `Navigator.pushNamed()`.

The `Navigator` widget provides various other methods and properties for managing navigation, such as `canPop()` to check if there is a previous route, `pushReplacement()` to replace the current route, and more. You can explore the Flutter documentation for more details on these methods and properties.

The `Navigator` widget is commonly used in scenarios where you have multiple screens or pages in your app and need to navigate between them. It helps in managing the navigation stack and provides a seamless user experience.
