The `TabBar` widget in Flutter is part of the `flutter/material.dart` library and is commonly used to create a tabbed navigation interface. It provides a set of tabs that the user can interact with to switch between different content or views within an app. Here's how to use the `TabBar` widget with code samples, including its properties and how to use it effectively:

### Basic Usage:

To use the `TabBar` widget, you typically need to follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

2. Create a `TabController`:

You need to create a `TabController` to manage the state of your tabs. The `TabController` keeps track of which tab is currently selected.

```dart
final myTabController = TabController(
  length: 3, // Number of tabs
  initialIndex: 0, // Index of the initially selected tab
);
```

3. Define your tabs:

```dart
TabBar(
  controller: myTabController, // Pass the TabController
  tabs: [
    Tab(text: 'Tab 1'), // Each tab is defined using Tab
    Tab(text: 'Tab 2'),
    Tab(text: 'Tab 3'),
  ],
)
```

4. Create a `TabBarView`:

The `TabBarView` widget is used to display the content corresponding to the selected tab. It should have the same length as the number of tabs.

```dart
TabBarView(
  controller: myTabController, // Pass the same TabController
  children: [
    // Content for Tab 1
    Center(child: Text('Tab 1 content')),
    // Content for Tab 2
    Center(child: Text('Tab 2 content')),
    // Content for Tab 3
    Center(child: Text('Tab 3 content')),
  ],
)
```

### Full Example:

Here's a complete example of a Flutter app using `TabBar`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  final myTabController = TabController(
    length: 3,
    initialIndex: 0,
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('TabBar Example'),
          bottom: TabBar(
            controller: myTabController,
            tabs: [
              Tab(text: 'Tab 1'),
              Tab(text: 'Tab 2'),
              Tab(text: 'Tab 3'),
            ],
          ),
        ),
        body: TabBarView(
          controller: myTabController,
          children: [
            Center(child: Text('Tab 1 content')),
            Center(child: Text('Tab 2 content')),
            Center(child: Text('Tab 3 content')),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### TabBar Properties:

The `TabBar` widget has several properties that allow you to customize its appearance and behavior:

- `controller`: The `TabController` that manages the state of the tabs.
- `tabs`: A list of `Tab` widgets, where each `Tab` represents a tab in the `TabBar`.
- `isScrollable`: A boolean that determines whether the tabs can be scrolled horizontally if there are too many to fit on the screen.
- `labelColor` and `unselectedLabelColor`: Define the text color of the selected and unselected tabs.
- `indicatorColor`: Set the color of the indicator line beneath the selected tab.
- `indicatorWeight` and `indicatorPadding`: Customize the appearance of the indicator.
- `labelStyle` and `unselectedLabelStyle`: Define the text style for labels on selected and unselected tabs.
- `onTap`: A callback function that is called when a tab is tapped.

These properties give you control over how the `TabBar` appears and behaves in your app.

The `TabBar` widget is useful for creating navigation interfaces, such as a bottom navigation bar or a top app bar with tabs. It's commonly used in scenarios where you want to switch between different sections or views of your app's content.
