In Flutter, the `TabBar` widget is used to create a horizontal row of tabs for navigation. It is typically used in conjunction with the `TabBarView` widget to display different content based on the selected tab.

Here's how you can use the `TabBar` widget with code samples:

1. Basic Usage:
   - To use the `TabBar` widget, you need to include it as the `tabs` property of a `TabBarView` widget.
   - The `TabBar` widget takes a list of `Tab` widgets as its children, where each `Tab` represents a tab in the tab bar.

   ```dart
   DefaultTabController(
     length: 3,
     child: Scaffold(
       appBar: AppBar(
         title: Text('My App'),
         bottom: TabBar(
           tabs: [
             Tab(text: 'Tab 1'),
             Tab(text: 'Tab 2'),
             Tab(text: 'Tab 3'),
           ],
         ),
       ),
       body: TabBarView(
         children: [
           // Content for Tab 1
           Container(
             child: Text('Tab 1 Content'),
           ),
           // Content for Tab 2
           Container(
             child: Text('Tab 2 Content'),
           ),
           // Content for Tab 3
           Container(
             child: Text('Tab 3 Content'),
           ),
         ],
       ),
     ),
   )
   ```

   In the above example, we create a `TabBar` with three tabs: "Tab 1", "Tab 2", and "Tab 3". The `TabBar` is included in the `AppBar` widget's `bottom` property. The corresponding content for each tab is displayed using the `TabBarView` widget.

2. Customization:
   - The `TabBar` widget provides several properties to customize its appearance and behavior.
   - Some commonly used properties include:
     - `tabs`: A list of `Tab` widgets representing the tabs in the tab bar.
     - `controller`: A `TabController` that manages the state of the tab bar.
     - `indicatorColor`: The color of the selected tab indicator.
     - `labelColor`: The color of the selected tab label.
     - `unselectedLabelColor`: The color of the unselected tab labels.
     - `indicatorWeight`: The thickness of the selected tab indicator.
     - `indicatorPadding`: The padding around the selected tab indicator.

   ```dart
   TabBar(
     tabs: [
       Tab(
         text: 'Tab 1',
         icon: Icon(Icons.home),
       ),
       Tab(
         text: 'Tab 2',
         icon: Icon(Icons.search),
       ),
       Tab(
         text: 'Tab 3',
         icon: Icon(Icons.settings),
       ),
     ],
     controller: _tabController,
     indicatorColor: Colors.blue,
     labelColor: Colors.blue,
     unselectedLabelColor: Colors.grey,
     indicatorWeight: 2.0,
     indicatorPadding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 16.0),
   )
   ```

   In the above example, we customize the `TabBar` by adding icons to the tabs using the `icon` property, setting the indicator color to blue, the label color to blue, the unselected label color to grey, the indicator weight to 2.0, and the indicator padding to 16.0.

The `TabBar` widget is commonly used in Flutter apps to provide a navigation mechanism using tabs. It allows users to switch between different sections or views within the app. It is often used in combination with the `TabBarView` widget to display different content for each tab.

The `TabBar` widget has various other properties that you can explore in the Flutter documentation, such as `isScrollable` to enable scrolling tabs, `dragStartBehavior` to control the behavior when dragging the tabs, and more.
