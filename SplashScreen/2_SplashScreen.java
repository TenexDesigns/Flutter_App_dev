A splash screen is the first screen that appears when a user opens an app. It's often used to display a logo or a progress indicator while the app is loading. Here's how you can create a splash screen in Flutter:

1. Import the necessary packages:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

2. Create a `SplashScreen` widget:
```dart
class SplashScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _SplashScreenState createState() => _SplashScreenState();
}

class _SplashScreenState extends State<SplashScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _navigateToHome();
  }

  _navigateToHome() async {
    // Simulate a service call
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
      MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => HomePage()),
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Loading...'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above example, we have a `SplashScreen` widget that displays a loading message. The `_navigateToHome` method is called in the `initState` method, which simulates a service call with a delay of 2 seconds and then navigates to the `HomePage`.

3. Use the `SplashScreen` as the initial route of your app:
```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'My App',
      home: SplashScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

In the above example, we have set the `SplashScreen` as the initial route of the app. So, when the app is launched, the splash screen will be displayed first.

By implementing the above steps, you can create a splash screen in Flutter that is displayed when the app is launched and navigates to the home page after a delay.
