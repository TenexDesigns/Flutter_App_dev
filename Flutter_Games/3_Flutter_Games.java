Flutter is a cross-platform framework that can be used to develop games for mobile, web, and desktop devices. It is a relatively new framework, but it has already been used to create a variety of popular games, including:

* Angry Birds Flutter
* Candy Crush Saga Flutter
* Fruit Ninja Flutter
* Temple Run Flutter
* Subway Surfers Flutter

These are just a few examples, and there are many other great games that have been made with Flutter.

Here are some of the widgets that are commonly used to make games in Flutter:

* **Image:** To display images in the game.
* **Text:** To display text in the game.
* **Container:** To group widgets together.
* **Positioned:** To position widgets on the screen.
* **AnimatedContainer:** To create animated containers.
* **AnimatedOpacity:** To create animated opacity effects.
* **GestureDetector:** To detect gestures on the screen.

To upscale your Flutter games, you can use the following game engines:

* **Flame:** A popular game engine for Flutter that provides a variety of features, such as physics, rendering, and input handling.
* **Unity:** A powerful game engine that can be used to create high-quality games for a variety of platforms.
* **Godot:** A free and open-source game engine that is easy to use and can be used to create games for a variety of platforms.

Which game engine you choose will depend on your specific needs and requirements. If you are new to game development, I recommend starting with Flame, as it is relatively easy to use and provides a good set of features.

Here are some tips for developing games with Flutter:

* Use the right widgets for the job. Flutter has a wide variety of widgets that you can use to create your game. Choose the widgets that are most appropriate for the task at hand.
* Use a game engine. A game engine can provide you with a number of useful features, such as physics, rendering, and input handling.
* Start small. Don't try to create a complex game right away. Start with a simple game and gradually add more features as you learn.
* Test your game often. Make sure to test your game on a variety of devices and platforms.
* Get feedback from others. Once you have a prototype of your game, get feedback from other people to see what they think.

I hope this helps!
