You can create various types of games in Flutter, including 2D games, puzzle games, trivia games, and more. Flutter's powerful UI framework enables you to build interactive and visually appealing games.

Here are some examples of games developed in Flutter:

1. **Hamilton Musical**: A trivia game built with Flutter [Source 1](https://www.dunebook.com/amazing-opensource-games-built-using-flutter/).
2. **Dashatar**: A Flutter web app demo to create a Dashatar for Flutter Engage [Source 3](https://flutter.dev/showcase).
3. **Flutter Plasma**: A Flutter app demonstrating Flutter's web graphics rendering capabilities [Source 3](https://flutter.dev/showcase).

To create games in Flutter, you can use various widgets depending on the type of game you want to build. For example, you can use the `GestureDetector` widget to handle user interactions, the `AnimatedContainer` widget to create animations, the `Stack` widget to layer multiple widgets on top of each other, and more.

In addition to Flutter's built-in widgets, you can use game engines to facilitate the game development process. A game engine is a software that provides game creators with the necessary set of features to build games quickly and efficiently.

Here are some game engines you can use with Flutter:

1. **Flame**: Flame is a minimalist Flutter game engine that provides a set of basic functionalities to make game development easier. You can use Flame to handle graphics, animations, audio, inputs, and more [Source 8](https://betterprogramming.pub/flutter-flame-intro-to-making-games-with-flutter-c4f5b2209a34).

```dart
import 'package:flame/flame.dart';
import 'package:flame/game.dart';

void main() {
  final myGame = MyGame();
  runApp(myGame.widget);
}

class MyGame extends Game {
  @override
  void render(Canvas canvas) {
    // Implement your render logic here
  }

  @override
  void update(double dt) {
    // Implement your update logic here
  }
}
```

2. **Unity**: You can use the Flutter Unity Widget to embed Unity projects in your Flutter app. This allows you to leverage Unity's powerful features and capabilities in your Flutter game [Source 15](https://fluttergems.dev/game-development/).

```dart
import 'package:flutter_unity_widget/flutter_unity_widget.dart';

class UnityViewPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _UnityViewPageState createState() => _UnityViewPageState();
}

class _UnityViewPageState extends State<UnityViewPage> {
  UnityWidgetController? _unityWidgetController;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return UnityWidget(
      onUnityCreated: onUnityCreated,
    );
  }

  void onUnityCreated(UnityWidgetController controller) {
    _unityWidgetController = controller;
  }
}
```

By using these game engines, you can upscale your Flutter games and create more complex and interactive gaming experiences.
