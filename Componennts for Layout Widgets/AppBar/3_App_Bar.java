To use an app bar in Flutter, you can use the `AppBar` widget. The `AppBar` widget allows you to display a bar at the top of the screen. The bar can contain a title, a search bar, and other widgets.

To use the `AppBar` widget, you would first create a new `AppBar` object. Then, you would add the widgets to the `AppBar` object. Finally, you would pass the `AppBar` object to the `Scaffold.appBar` property.

Here is an example of how to use the `AppBar` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('My App'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code will create an app bar with the title "My App".

The `AppBar` widget has a number of parameters that you can use to customize it. Here are some of the most common parameters:

* `title`: The title of the app bar.
* `leading`: The widget to display on the left side of the app bar.
* `actions`: The widgets to display on the right side of the app bar.
* `backgroundColor`: The background color of the app bar.
* `elevation`: The elevation of the app bar.
* `shape`: The shape of the app bar.

Here is an example of how to use some of the `AppBar` parameters:

```dart
AppBar(
  title: Text('My App'),
  leading: IconButton(
    icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
    onPressed: () {},
  ),
  actions: [
    IconButton(
      icon: Icon(Icons.search),
      onPressed: () {},
    ),
    IconButton(
      icon: Icon(Icons.settings),
      onPressed: () {},
    ),
  ],
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
  elevation: 10,
  shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
    borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
  ),
)
```

This code will create an app bar with the following features:

* A title with the text "My App".
* A menu button on the left side.
* A search button and a settings button on the right side.
* A blue background color.
* An elevation of 10.
* Rounded corners.

You can use the `AppBar` widget to create a variety of different app bars. You can experiment with the different parameters to create the desired look.

I hope this helps!
