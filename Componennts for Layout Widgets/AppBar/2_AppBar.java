To implement an AppBar in Flutter, you can use the `AppBar` widget. Here's an example of how to use it with code samples:

1. Import the necessary packages:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

2. Implement the `AppBar` widget within a `Scaffold` widget:
```dart
Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(
    title: Text('My App'),
    actions: [
      IconButton(
        icon: Icon(Icons.search),
        onPressed: () {
          // Perform search action
        },
      ),
      IconButton(
        icon: Icon(Icons.settings),
        onPressed: () {
          // Perform settings action
        },
      ),
    ],
  ),
  body: Container(
    // Your app content goes here
  ),
);
```

In the above example, we have defined an `AppBar` with a title and two action buttons. The `title` property is set to a `Text` widget with the text "My App". The `actions` property is set to a list of `IconButton` widgets, each representing an action button in the app bar.

3. Customize the `AppBar` appearance and behavior using its parameters:
- `backgroundColor`: Sets the background color of the app bar.
- `elevation`: Sets the elevation (shadow) of the app bar.
- `brightness`: Sets the brightness of the app bar, which affects the color of the status bar icons.
- `automaticallyImplyLeading`: Controls whether to automatically include a back button or not.
- `leading`: Sets a widget to be displayed as the leading widget in the app bar.
- `actions`: Sets a list of widgets to be displayed as action buttons in the app bar.
- `centerTitle`: Controls whether to center the title or not.
- `title`: Sets the title widget of the app bar.
- `flexibleSpace`: Sets a widget to be displayed behind the toolbar and below the status bar.
- `bottom`: Sets a widget to be displayed below the toolbar.

You can customize the `AppBar` based on your app's requirements by adjusting these parameters.
