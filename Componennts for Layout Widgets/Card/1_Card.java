The `Card` widget in Flutter is a material design card. It is a rectangular-shaped container with a shadow that represents a concept, component, or piece of information. Cards are commonly used to group related information and provide a visually appealing way to display content.

Here are some of the key properties and parameters of the `Card` widget:

- **child**: The widget that is placed inside the card as its content. It can be any Flutter widget, including text, images, lists, or custom widgets.

- **elevation**: The shadow depth of the card, which determines how raised it appears on the screen. The higher the elevation value, the more pronounced the shadow.

- **color**: The background color of the card. You can use the `Color` class to specify a color.

- **shape**: The shape of the card. By default, it's a rectangular shape, but you can customize it using the `RoundedRectangleBorder` or other shape classes.

- **margin**: The amount of space around the card. You can use the `EdgeInsets` class to set margins.

- **borderOnForeground**: A Boolean that indicates whether the border should be drawn in front of the child content. If `true`, the border is drawn on top of the child; if `false`, it's drawn behind the child.

Here's an example of how to use the `Card` widget in a Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Card Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Card(
            elevation: 5, // Shadow depth
            margin: EdgeInsets.all(20), // Margin around the card
            child: Column(
              mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
              children: <Widget>[
                ListTile(
                  title: Text('Card Title'),
                  subtitle: Text('Subtitle'),
                ),
                ButtonBar(
                  children: <Widget>[
                    FlatButton(
                      child: Text('Button 1'),
                      onPressed: () {},
                    ),
                    FlatButton(
                      child: Text('Button 2'),
                      onPressed: () {},
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we create a simple Flutter app with an `AppBar` and a `Card` widget. Inside the `Card`, we have a `Column` with a `ListTile` for the card's title and subtitle, and a `ButtonBar` with two buttons. You can customize the content and appearance of the `Card` widget according to your application's requirements.

`Card` widgets are commonly used for various purposes, such as displaying lists of items, showing details of a selected item, or organizing content in a visually appealing way. They provide a consistent material design look and feel to your Flutter app.
