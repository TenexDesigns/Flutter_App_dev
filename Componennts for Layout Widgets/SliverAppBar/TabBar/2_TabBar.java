In Flutter, you can create a tab bar using the `DefaultTabController` widget, which provides a simple way to manage a set of tabs along with their associated content. Here's how to use the `DefaultTabController` with code samples to create a tab bar in Flutter:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**:

   First, make sure you have the necessary Flutter libraries imported in your Dart file:

   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
   ```

2. **Create a TabBar Widget**:

   Define the tabs you want to display using the `Tab` widget. Here's an example with three tabs:

   ```dart
   final List<Tab> tabs = [
     Tab(text: 'Tab 1'),
     Tab(text: 'Tab 2'),
     Tab(text: 'Tab 3'),
   ];
   ```

3. **Create a DefaultTabController**:

   Wrap your `TabBar` and the content associated with each tab in a `DefaultTabController` widget:

   ```dart
   DefaultTabController(
     length: tabs.length, // The number of tabs
     child: Scaffold(
       appBar: AppBar(
         title: Text('Tab Bar Example'),
         bottom: TabBar(
           tabs: tabs, // The list of Tab widgets
         ),
       ),
       body: TabBarView(
         children: <Widget>[
           // Content for Tab 1
           Center(
             child: Text('Tab 1 Content'),
           ),
           // Content for Tab 2
           Center(
             child: Text('Tab 2 Content'),
           ),
           // Content for Tab 3
           Center(
             child: Text('Tab 3 Content'),
           ),
         ],
       ),
     ),
   )
   ```

4. **Run Your Flutter App**:

   Save your Dart file and run your Flutter app. You'll see a tab bar with three tabs and their associated content.

Here's an explanation of the code:

- The `DefaultTabController` widget is used to specify the number of tabs (length) and provide the child widget where the tab bar and tab content will be displayed.

- Inside the `Scaffold`, the `AppBar` widget is used to create a standard app bar with a title.

- The `TabBar` widget is placed inside the `AppBar` using the `bottom` property. It receives the list of `Tab` widgets you defined earlier.

- The `TabBarView` widget contains the content for each tab. You can customize the content for each tab by adding different widgets.

- Each tab's content is defined inside the `TabBarView` widget. In this example, each tab displays a simple `Text` widget, but you can replace them with any widgets you like.

By following these steps, you can create a basic tab bar in your Flutter app. You can further customize the appearance and behavior of the tab bar by adjusting properties and styles as needed.
