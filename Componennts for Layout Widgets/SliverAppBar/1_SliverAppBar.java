In Flutter, the `SliverAppBar` widget is used within a `CustomScrollView` to create flexible app bars with various scrolling effects, such as pinned app bars that stick to the top or expand as you scroll through a scrollable area. Here's a basic example of how to use `SliverAppBar` with code samples:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: CustomScrollView(
          slivers: <Widget>[
            SliverAppBar(
              expandedHeight: 200, // Height when fully expanded
              floating: false, // App bar is not floating
              pinned: true, // App bar stays pinned at the top
              flexibleSpace: FlexibleSpaceBar(
                title: Text('SliverAppBar Example'),
                background: Image.asset('assets/image.jpg', fit: BoxFit.cover),
              ),
            ),
            SliverList(
              delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
                (BuildContext context, int index) {
                  return ListTile(title: Text('Item $index'));
                },
                childCount: 50, // Number of list items
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code example:

1. We create a basic Flutter app with a `CustomScrollView` as the main content of a `Scaffold`.

2. Inside the `CustomScrollView`, we add a `SliverAppBar` widget. Key parameters for `SliverAppBar` are as follows:

   - `expandedHeight`: Specifies the height of the app bar when fully expanded. You can adjust this value to set the desired height for the expanded app bar.

   - `floating`: When set to `true`, the app bar will be floating, meaning it will scroll away when you scroll down. In this example, it's set to `false`.

   - `pinned`: When set to `true`, the app bar will stay pinned to the top as you scroll down. In this example, it's set to `true`.

   - `flexibleSpace`: This is the content within the app bar. It's typically a `FlexibleSpaceBar` widget that can include an image, title, or any other widgets.

3. Inside the `FlexibleSpaceBar`, we have a title and an image as background. You can customize this part as needed.

4. Below the `SliverAppBar`, we have a `SliverList` that contains a list of items. This is just an example to demonstrate how you can use `SliverAppBar` with other slivers in the same `CustomScrollView`.

Make sure to replace `'assets/image.jpg'` with the path to your own image asset. You can further customize the appearance and behavior of the `SliverAppBar` to suit your specific design and interaction requirements.
