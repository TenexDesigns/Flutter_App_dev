To make authenticated requests in Flutter, you can use the `http` package. The `http` package provides a simple way to make HTTP requests. You can use it to make authenticated requests by passing in an authorization header.

The following code sample shows how to make an authenticated request using the `http` package:

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart';

Future<Response> makeAuthenticatedRequest(String url, String token) async {
  // Create a request object.
  final request = Request('GET', Uri.parse(url));

  // Add the authorization header.
  request.headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer $token';

  // Send the request and wait for the response.
  final response = await request.send();

  return response;
}
```

To use the `makeAuthenticatedRequest()` function, you will need to pass in the URL of the request and the authorization token. The authorization token can be obtained from the authentication service that you are using.

Once you have the authorization token, you can call the `makeAuthenticatedRequest()` function to make the request. The function will return a `Response` object, which you can use to get the response from the server.

The following code sample shows how to use the `makeAuthenticatedRequest()` function to make an authenticated request to the GitHub API:

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  // Get the authorization token.
  final token = 'YOUR_GITHUB_API_TOKEN';

  // Make the request.
  final response = await makeAuthenticatedRequest('https://api.github.com/users/bard', token);

  // Check the status code of the response.
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // The request was successful.
    // Parse the response body as JSON.
    final user = jsonDecode(response.body) as Map<String, dynamic>;

    // Print the user's name.
    print(user['name']);
  } else {
    // The request failed.
    print('Request failed: ${response.statusCode}');
  }
}
```

This code will print the user's name to the console. You can modify the code to make other authenticated requests to the GitHub API, or to other APIs.

The `http` package is a powerful tool for making HTTP requests in Flutter. By using the `http` package, you can easily make authenticated requests to any API that supports HTTP authentication.
