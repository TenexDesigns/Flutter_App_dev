Making authenticated requests in Flutter typically involves including an authentication token or other credentials in the headers of your HTTP requests. This allows the server to verify the identity of the user or application making the request. You can use packages like `http` to send authenticated requests in Flutter. Here's an example of how to make an authenticated GET request using the `http` package:

First, make sure you have added the `http` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.3
```

Then run `flutter pub get` to get the package.

Here's an example of making an authenticated GET request with an access token in the headers:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> fetchAuthenticatedData(String accessToken) async {
  final url = Uri.parse('https://api.example.com/data');
  final response = await http.get(
    url,
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer $accessToken', // Include your access token here
    },
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    // Successful response
    print('Response data: ${response.body}');
  } else {
    // Handle errors
    print('Request failed with status: ${response.statusCode}');
    print('Response data: ${response.body}');
  }
}
```

In this example, we're adding an access token to the `Authorization` header with the 'Bearer' prefix. Make sure to replace `'Bearer $accessToken'` with your actual access token. The server you're making the request to should specify the format it expects for the authorization header.

The response is checked for a status code of 200 to determine if the request was successful. You can customize the error handling based on the server's response format.

This is a basic example of making authenticated requests in Flutter. The exact method and headers you need to use will depend on the authentication mechanism your server uses (e.g., OAuth, JWT, API key).
