The `image_picker` and `image_gallery_saver` packages in Flutter are used to pick images/videos from the device's gallery or camera and save images to the gallery respectively.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use them:

1. **Add the necessary dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file**:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  image_picker: ^0.8.4+2
  image_gallery_saver: ^1.7.1
  permission_handler: ^8.1.6
```

2. **Import the `image_picker`, `image_gallery_saver`, and `permission_handler` packages in your Dart file**:

```dart
import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';
import 'package:image_gallery_saver/image_gallery_saver.dart';
import 'package:permission_handler/permission_handler.dart';
```

3. **Pick an image from the gallery or camera**:

You can pick an image from the gallery or camera using the `pickImage` method of the `ImagePicker` class:

```dart
final picker = ImagePicker();

Future<void> pickImage() async {
  final pickedFile = await picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);

  if (pickedFile != null) {
    print('Picked image path: ${pickedFile.path}');
  } else {
    print('No image selected.');
  }
}
```

In this example, `picker.pickImage` is used to pick an image from the gallery. You can change `ImageSource.gallery` to `ImageSource.camera` to pick an image from the camera.

4. **Save an image to the gallery**:

You can save an image to the gallery using the `saveFile` method of the `ImageGallerySaver` class:

```dart
Future<void> saveImage() async {
  final pickedFile = await picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);

  if (pickedFile != null) {
    final result = await ImageGallerySaver.saveFile(pickedFile.path);

    print('Image saved to gallery: $result');
  } else {
    print('No image selected.');
  }
}
```

In this example, `ImageGallerySaver.saveFile` is used to save the picked image to the gallery.

Remember to check and request the necessary permissions before picking or saving an image. You might need to request the `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions on Android and the `photos` permission on iOS. You can use the `permission_handler` package to handle permissions in Flutter.

Also, note that the `image_picker` package can also be used to pick videos from the gallery or camera by using the `pickVideo` method, and the `image_gallery_saver` package can also be used to save videos to the gallery.
