In Flutter, widgets are the most basic building blocks to create interactive user interfaces for various mobile applications. Widgets can either be classified as either stateless or stateful in Flutter. Understanding the difference between these two main types of widgets in Flutter is crucial for building powerful and responsive apps that behave according to the user's needs[2][3].

A stateless widget is immutable and completely stateless. This means that these widgets do not hold any internal state. Stateless widgets are useful in scenarios where the UI remains the same regardless of external factors. For example, a label displaying the application logo or a heading introducing a section of the app can be implemented as stateless widgets[2][3][5][6].

On the other hand, stateful widgets are dynamic and can hold their internal state over time. These widgets are called Stateful widgets. Stateful widgets are used when you need to build a widget that can change its appearance based on some dynamic state. For example, a button that changes color when it is pressed, or a text input field that updates its content as the user types[2][3][5][6].

The process to create a stateful widget in Flutter involves creating two separate classes: the widget class itself, which is immutable, and a corresponding state class, which is mutable and holds the state data. The state class extends the `State<StatefulWidget>` class. The `setState()` function is one of the most important differences between the stateless and stateful widgets in Flutter. This function allows real-time updates to the state of the widget[2][3].

To create a stateless widget in Flutter, you need to create a class that extends the `StatelessWidget` class and override the `build()` method to return a widget. To create a stateful widget in Flutter, you need to create a class that extends the `StatefulWidget` class and override the `createState()` method to return a state object[2][3].

In summary, stateless widgets are immutable and completely stateless, while stateful widgets are dynamic and can hold their internal state over time. The process to create a stateful widget in Flutter involves creating two separate classes: the widget class itself, which is immutable, and a corresponding state class, which is mutable and holds the state data. The `setState()` function is one of the most important differences between the stateless and stateful widgets in Flutter.
