The sqflite plugin in Flutter is a wrapper around the SQLite database engine. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for performing database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

Methods provided by the sqflite plugin

The sqflite plugin provides a number of methods for performing database operations. Some of the most common methods include:

openDatabase(): Opens a database or creates a new one if it does not exist.
query(): Queries the database and returns a list of results.
insert(): Inserts a new row into the database.
update(): Updates a row in the database.
delete(): Deletes a row from the database.
How to insert and do CRUD operations with the sqflite plugin

To insert a new row into the database, you can use the insert() method. The insert() method takes the table name and a map of column values as parameters. For example, the following code shows how to insert a new row into the users table:

Dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

Future<void> insertUser(User user) async {
  var db = await openDatabase('my_database.db');

  await db.insert('users', user.toMap());
}

To query the database, you can use the query() method. The query() method takes the table name and a list of columns to return as parameters. For example, the following code shows how to query the users table and return all of the rows:

Dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

Future<List<User>> getUsers() async {
  var db = await openDatabase('my_database.db');

  var users = await db.query('users', columns: ['id', 'name', 'email']);

  return users.map((user) => User.fromMap(user)).toList();
}

To update a row in the database, you can use the update() method. The update() method takes the table name, a map of column values, and a where clause as parameters. For example, the following code shows how to update the name column of the users table for the user with the ID of 1:

Dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

Future<void> updateUserName(int id, String name) async {
  var db = await openDatabase('my_database.db');

  await db.update('users', {'name': name}, where: 'id = ?', whereArgs: [id]);
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
To delete a row from the database, you can use the delete() method. The delete() method takes the table name and a where clause as parameters. For example, the following code shows how to delete the user with the ID of 1 from the users table:

Dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

Future<void> deleteUser(int id) async {
  var db = await openDatabase('my_database.db');

  await db.delete('users', where: 'id = ?', whereArgs: [id]);
}

What the sqflite plugin's methods return

The sqflite plugin's methods return a variety of different values, depending on the method being called. For example, the insert() method returns the ID of the newly inserted row, while the query() method returns a list of results.

Here is a summary of the return values of some of the most common sqflite plugin methods:

Method	Return value
openDatabase()	A Future that completes when the database is opened or created.
query()	A Future that completes when the query is finished and returns a list of results.
insert()	A Future that completes when the row is inserted and returns the ID of the newly inserted row.
update()	A Future that completes when the row is updated.
delete()	A Future that completes when the row is deleted.
I hope this helps!
