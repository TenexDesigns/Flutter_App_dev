To use custom fonts in Flutter, you should follow these steps:

1. **Download the font files**: You can get the custom font files from various sources such as Google Fonts. The files are usually in `.ttf` or `.otf` format [Source 1](https://blog.logrocket.com/use-custom-fonts-flutter/).

2. **Add the font files to your project**: Create a folder named `fonts` in the root of your Flutter project and move the font files into this folder [Source 1](https://blog.logrocket.com/use-custom-fonts-flutter/).

```plaintext
my_app/
  lib
  fonts/
    CustomFont-Regular.ttf
```

3. **Declare the fonts in the `pubspec.yaml` file**: The `pubspec.yaml` file is a manifest file that defines your project and its dependencies. You need to declare your fonts under the `fonts` section in the `pubspec.yaml` file. This declaration should include the `family` (the name you will use in your code to reference the font) and the `fonts` (the font file assets) [Source 21](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec) [Source 14](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/pub/pubspec).

```yaml
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: CustomFont
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/CustomFont-Regular.ttf
```

If your font has different styles like italic or weights like bold, you can specify them in the `fonts` section. The `style` property specifies if the font style is normal or italic, and the `weight` property specifies the weight of the font [Source 0](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts).

```yaml
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: CustomFont
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/CustomFont-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/CustomFont-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/CustomFont-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
```

4. **Use the font in your Flutter application**: You can now use the custom font in your Flutter application. You do this by using the `fontFamily` property of the `TextStyle` widget. The value of the `fontFamily` should match the `family` name you declared in the `pubspec.yaml` file [Source 0](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/fonts).

```dart
Text(
  'This is a custom font',
  style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'CustomFont'),
)
```

Remember to run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to update your project's dependencies after editing the `pubspec.yaml` file.

In conclusion, the `pubspec.yaml` file is a crucial part of a Flutter project as it defines the project and its dependencies. By editing this file, you can add custom fonts to your Flutter application and use them to enhance the look and feel of your application.
