`ClipRRect` is a Flutter widget that clips its child using a rounded rectangle. It's commonly used to create rounded corners for images, containers, or other widgets. The `ClipRRect` widget allows you to specify a `borderRadius` to control the amount of rounding applied to the corners.

Here's an example of how to use `ClipRRect`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('ClipRRect Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ClipRRect(
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16.0),
            child: Image.network(
              'https://example.com/image.jpg',
              width: 200,
              height: 200,
              fit: BoxFit.cover,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code:

1. We define a `ClipRRect` widget with a `borderRadius` of `BorderRadius.circular(16.0)`. This gives the child a rounded rectangle shape.

2. The child of `ClipRRect` is an `Image` widget that loads an image from a URL. The image is clipped with rounded corners.

3. The `fit` property of the `Image` is set to `BoxFit.cover` to ensure that the image covers the entire space of the `ClipRRect`.

You can use `ClipRRect` to create rounded corners for various widgets, including images, containers, or even custom widgets. It's especially useful for creating visually appealing designs in your Flutter app. You can adjust the `borderRadius` property to control the amount of rounding according to your design requirements.
