The `Radio` widget in Flutter is used to create radio buttons for selecting a single option from a group. It allows users to choose only one option at a time. The `Radio` widget is typically used in forms or settings screens where users need to make a single selection from a list of options.

Here are the important properties of the `Radio` widget:

- **`value`**: This property represents the value of the radio button. It can be of any type.

- **`groupValue`**: This property represents the currently selected value from the group of radio buttons. It must match the `value` property of the selected radio button.

- **`onChanged`**: This property is a callback function that is called when the user selects a radio button. It takes a function that accepts the selected value as a parameter.

Here's an example of how to use the `Radio` widget:

```dart
enum Gender { male, female }

Gender selectedGender = Gender.male;

Column(
  children: <Widget>[
    RadioListTile<Gender>(
      title: const Text('Male'),
      value: Gender.male,
      groupValue: selectedGender,
      onChanged: (Gender value) {
        setState(() {
          selectedGender = value;
        });
      },
    ),
    RadioListTile<Gender>(
      title: const Text('Female'),
      value: Gender.female,
      groupValue: selectedGender,
      onChanged: (Gender value) {
        setState(() {
          selectedGender = value;
        });
      },
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, the `Radio` widget is used to create two radio buttons for selecting the gender. The `value` property represents the value of each radio button (`Gender.male` and `Gender.female`). The `groupValue` property represents the currently selected gender. The `onChanged` property is a callback function that updates the `selectedGender` variable with the selected value.

You can use the `Radio` widget in various places in your Flutter application, such as in forms, settings screens, or any place where you need to provide a single selection from a group of options.
