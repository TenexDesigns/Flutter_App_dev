The FutureBuilder widget in Flutter allows you to build a widget based on the latest snapshot of a Future. 
  It is a convenient way to handle asynchronous operations in your Flutter apps.

**Parameters**

The FutureBuilder widget has the following parameters:

* **future:** The Future to listen to.
* **initialData:** The initial data to display until the Future completes.
* **builder:** A callback that builds a widget based on the latest snapshot of the Future.

**When to use**

You should use the FutureBuilder widget when you need to display a widget based on the latest snapshot of a Future. 
  This can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as:

* Displaying data that is loaded asynchronously from a network or database.
* Displaying a loading indicator while asynchronous operations are in progress.
* Displaying an error message if an asynchronous operation fails.

**Code samples**

The following code sample shows how to use the FutureBuilder widget to display a list of items that are loaded asynchronously from a network:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final items = Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () => ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']);

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: FutureBuilder(
          future: items,
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            if (snapshot.hasData) {
              final itemsList = snapshot.data as List<String>;

              return ListView.builder(
                itemCount: itemsList.length,
                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return Text(itemsList[index]);
                },
              );
            } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
              return Text('Error loading items: ${snapshot.error}');
            } else {
              return CircularProgressIndicator();
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code will display a loading indicator while the Future is in progress. Once the Future completes, the list of items will be displayed. If the Future fails, an error message will be displayed.

**Conclusion**

The FutureBuilder widget is a convenient way to handle asynchronous operations in your Flutter apps. It is an essential tool for any Flutter developer.
