The `FutureBuilder` widget in Flutter is used to asynchronously build a widget tree based on the result of a `Future`. It allows you to handle different states of the `Future`, such as when it is still loading, when it has completed successfully, or when it has encountered an error.

Here is an example of how to use the `FutureBuilder` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class FutureBuilderExample extends StatelessWidget {
  Future<String> fetchData() async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
    return 'Data loaded successfully';
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('FutureBuilder Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: FutureBuilder<String>(
          future: fetchData(),
          builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot<String> snapshot) {
            if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
              return CircularProgressIndicator();
            } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
              return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
            } else {
              return Text('Data: ${snapshot.data}');
            }
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we have a `FutureBuilder` widget that takes a `Future` called `fetchData()` as its `future` parameter. Inside the `builder` function, we check the `connectionState` of the `snapshot` to determine the current state of the `Future`. If the `connectionState` is `waiting`, we display a `CircularProgressIndicator` to indicate that the data is still loading. If the `snapshot` has an error, we display an error message. Otherwise, we display the data retrieved from the `Future`.

You can use the `FutureBuilder` widget whenever you need to asynchronously fetch data and update the UI based on the result of the `Future`. It is commonly used for making API calls, fetching data from a database, or performing any asynchronous operation.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
