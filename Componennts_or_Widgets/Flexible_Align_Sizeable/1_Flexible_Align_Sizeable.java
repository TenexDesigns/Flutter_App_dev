`Flexible`, `SizedBox`, and `Align` are useful Flutter widgets for creating flexible layouts, adding spacing, and aligning child widgets. Here's an explanation and code samples for each:

1. `Flexible` Widget:
   - The `Flexible` widget is used to create flexible space within a `Row`, `Column`, or `Flex` layout. It allows a child widget to take up a portion of the available space.
   - The `flex` property specifies how the space is distributed among child widgets within the same `Flex` parent.
   
   Code Sample:
   ```dart
   Row(
     children: <Widget>[
       Flexible(
         flex: 2,  // Takes twice as much space as the second Flexible
         child: Container(color: Colors.red),
       ),
       Flexible(
         flex: 1,
         child: Container(color: Colors.blue),
       ),
     ],
   )
   ```

2. `SizedBox` Widget:
   - The `SizedBox` widget is used to create a box of fixed dimensions (width and height).
   - It's helpful for adding spacing or setting a minimum or maximum size for other widgets.

   Code Sample:
   ```dart
   SizedBox(
     width: 100.0,
     height: 50.0,
     child: RaisedButton(
       onPressed: () {},
       child: Text('Click Me'),
     ),
   )
   ```

3. `Align` Widget:
   - The `Align` widget is used to align its child within a parent widget.
   - You can specify the alignment using properties like `alignment` (alignment within the parent) and `child` (the widget to be aligned).

   Code Sample:
   ```dart
   Align(
     alignment: Alignment.center,
     child: Text('Centered Text'),
   )
   ```

You can use these widgets to create flexible and organized layouts in your Flutter app. They are especially useful when working with `Row`, `Column`, and other layout widgets to control how widgets are displayed within them and provide the desired spacing and alignment.
