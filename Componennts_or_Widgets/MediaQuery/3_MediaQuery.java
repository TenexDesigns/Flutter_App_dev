The `MediaQuery` widget in Flutter is used to retrieve information about the current device's screen size, orientation, and other device-specific properties. It allows you to create responsive layouts and adapt your UI based on the device's characteristics.

Here is an example of how to use the `MediaQuery` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MediaQueryExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('MediaQuery Example'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Container(
          color: Colors.blue,
          width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width * 0.8,
          height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.5,
          child: Center(
            child: Text(
              'MediaQuery',
              style: TextStyle(
                fontSize: 24,
                color: Colors.white,
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we have a `Container` widget that uses the `MediaQuery` widget to set its width and height based on the device's screen size. The `MediaQuery.of(context).size.width` retrieves the width of the screen, and `MediaQuery.of(context).size.height` retrieves the height of the screen. We then multiply these values by 0.8 and 0.5 respectively to set the width and height of the container to 80% and 50% of the screen size.

You can use the `MediaQuery` widget whenever you need to retrieve information about the device's screen size or other device-specific properties. It is commonly used for creating responsive layouts, adapting UI elements based on screen size, or making decisions based on the device's orientation.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
