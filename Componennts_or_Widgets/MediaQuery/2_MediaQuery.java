The MediaQuery widget in Flutter provides information about the current environment, such as the screen size, device orientation, and user preferences. It can be used to adapt your app's layout and behavior to the different devices and environments that it may run on.

**Parameters**

The MediaQuery widget has the following parameters:

* **child:** The widget to wrap in the MediaQuery.
* **data:** The MediaQueryData object that contains information about the current environment.

**When to use**

You should use the MediaQuery widget when you need to adapt your app's layout and behavior to the different devices and environments that it may run on. This can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as:

* Designing a responsive layout that looks good on all devices.
* Adjusting the font size or other UI elements based on the user's preferences.
* Detecting changes to the device orientation and adjusting the layout accordingly.

**Code samples**

The following code sample shows how to use the MediaQuery widget to get the screen size:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final size = MediaQuery.of(context).size;

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text('The screen size is ${size.width} x ${size.height}.'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code will display the screen size in the center of the app.

The following code sample shows how to use the MediaQuery widget to adjust the font size based on the user's preferences:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final fontSize = MediaQuery.of(context).textScaleFactor * 16.0;

    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text('This text is ${fontSize.toStringAsFixed(1)} pixels in size.', style: TextStyle(fontSize: fontSize)),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This code will display the text "This text is 16.0 pixels in size." in the center of the app. The font size will be adjusted based on the user's preferences.

**Conclusion**

The MediaQuery widget is a powerful tool for adapting your app's layout and behavior to the different devices and environments that it may run on. It is an essential tool for any Flutter developer.
