In Flutter, the `Text` widget is used to display a piece of text in your app's user interface. It's a fundamental widget for rendering text, and it allows you to customize the text's appearance and style. The `Text` widget has several properties and parameters that allow you to control how the text is displayed.

Here's an overview of some important properties and how to use the `Text` widget with code samples:

1. **`data` (required)**: This property defines the text content you want to display. It's a required parameter, and you pass a string as its value.

   ```dart
   Text('Hello, Flutter!')
   ```

2. **`style`**: The `style` property allows you to customize the text's appearance, such as the font size, color, weight, and more. You use a `TextStyle` object to define these properties.

   ```dart
   Text(
     'Custom Text Style',
     style: TextStyle(
       fontSize: 24,
       fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
       color: Colors.blue,
     ),
   )
   ```

3. **`textAlign`**: This property controls the alignment of the text within its container. You can set it to `TextAlign.left`, `TextAlign.center`, or `TextAlign.right`.

   ```dart
   Text(
     'Centered Text',
     textAlign: TextAlign.center,
   )
   ```

4. **`maxLines`**: You can use this property to limit the number of lines the text can occupy. It's useful for creating text with ellipsis when it overflows.

   ```dart
   Text(
     'This text can have at most two lines before it gets truncated.',
     maxLines: 2,
     overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
   )
   ```

5. **`overflow`**: Determines how the text should behave when it overflows its container. You can set it to `TextOverflow.clip` (default), `TextOverflow.ellipsis`, `TextOverflow.fade`, or `TextOverflow.visible`.

6. **`softWrap`**: This property controls whether the text should wrap to the next line if it doesn't fit within the container.

   ```dart
   Text(
     'This is a long text that may wrap to the next line if softWrap is true.',
     softWrap: true,
   )
   ```

7. **`textScaleFactor`**: Allows you to adjust the text's size by specifying a scaling factor. This can be helpful for accommodating different device screen sizes.

   ```dart
   Text(
     'Scaled Text',
     textScaleFactor: 1.5, // Increases text size by 50%
   )
   ```

Here's an example of a Flutter app that uses the `Text` widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Text Widget Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              Text(
                'Hello, Flutter!',
                style: TextStyle(
                  fontSize: 24,
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                  color: Colors.blue,
                ),
              ),
              Text(
                'Centered Text',
                textAlign: TextAlign.center,
              ),
              Text(
                'This is a long text that may wrap to the next line if softWrap is true.',
                softWrap: true,
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we've used the `Text` widget to display various text elements with different styles and alignments. You can customize the appearance and behavior of text in your Flutter app by adjusting the properties of the `Text` widget as needed.
