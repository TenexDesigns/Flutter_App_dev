`ReorderableListView` is a Flutter widget that allows you to create a list view with items that can be reordered by dragging and dropping. It's particularly useful when you want to implement a list with items that users can rearrange as they desire.

Here's an example of how to use `ReorderableListView` in Flutter:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: MyReorderableList(),
    );
  }
}

class MyReorderableList extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyReorderableListState createState() => _MyReorderableListState();
}

class _MyReorderableListState extends State<MyReorderableList> {
  List<String> items = List.generate(10, (index) => 'Item ${index + 1}');

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Reorderable List Example'),
      ),
      body: ReorderableListView(
        children: <Widget>[
          for (var item in items)
            ListTile(
              key: ValueKey(item),
              title: Text(item),
            ),
        ],
        onReorder: (int oldIndex, int newIndex) {
          setState(() {
            if (oldIndex < newIndex) {
              newIndex -= 1;
            }
            final String item = items.removeAt(oldIndex);
            items.insert(newIndex, item);
          });
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we:

1. Create a `ReorderableListView` with a list of items wrapped in `ListTile` widgets.
2. The `key` property with `ValueKey` is set for each `ListTile` to ensure proper reordering.
3. Implement the `onReorder` callback, which gets called when the user reorders items. It updates the `items` list to reflect the new order.
4. When you run this app, you'll see a list of items that you can reorder by long-pressing and dragging them.

`ReorderableListView` simplifies the process of creating reorderable lists in Flutter and is especially handy when you need to allow users to customize the order of items in a list-based interface.
