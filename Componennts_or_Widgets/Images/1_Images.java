To display images in Flutter, you can use the Image widget. The Image widget can display images from both local and remote sources. Here are some of the ways to display images in Flutter:

1. Displaying images from the internet:

To display images from the internet, you can use the Image.network() constructor. This constructor takes a URL as its argument and loads the image from the internet. Here is an example:

```

Image.network('https://example.com/image.jpg');

```

```

Container (
  
         child:   Image.network( 'https://example.com/image.jpg',  );
             )


```

2. Displaying images from local assets:

To display images from local assets, you need to add the images to the assets folder in your Flutter project and specify them in the `pubspec.yaml` file. Here is an example:

```
Image.asset(
  'assets/images/image.jpg',
);
```

```

Container (
  
         child:   Image.assets('images/image.jpg');   // The Image should be in the assets folder, but  it is not a mst to start with the assets folder in ghe file path in this case
             )


```


3. Displaying images from local files:

To display images from local files, you can use the Image.file() constructor. This constructor takes a File object as its argument and loads the image from the file. Here is an example:

```
Image.file(
  File('/path/to/image.jpg'),
);
```

You can also customize the appearance of the images using various properties of the Image widget, such as height, width, fit, alignment, etc.

Here is an example of how to display an image from local assets with custom height and width:

```
Image.asset(
  'assets/images/image.jpg',
  height: 200,
  width: 200,
);
```

In summary, to display images in Flutter, you can use the Image widget and specify the source of the image using the Image.network(), Image.asset(), or Image.file() constructor. You can also customize the appearance of the images using various properties of the Image widget.
