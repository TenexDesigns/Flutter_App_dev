The Flutter Floating Action Button (FAB) is a circular button that floats above the UI. It is typically used to perform a primary action in the app, such as creating a new item or saving a changes.

To use the FAB, you need to add a `FloatingActionButton` widget to your layout. You can then specify the icon, text, and callback function for the button.

Here is a simple example of using a FAB:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, world!'),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Perform the primary action in the app.
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

The FAB has a number of props that can be used to customize its appearance and behavior. Some of the most important props are:

* `onPressed`: The callback function to be called when the button is pressed.
* `child`: The widget to display inside the button. This is typically an icon, but it can also be text or another widget.
* `tooltip`: The tooltip to display when the user long-presses the button.
* `backgroundColor`: The background color of the button.
* `foregroundColor`: The foreground color of the button.
* `shape`: The shape of the button. This is typically a circle, but it can also be a custom shape.
* `elevation`: The elevation of the button. This controls how much the button floats above the UI.

Here is an example of using some of the FAB's props:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, world!'),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Perform the primary action in the app.
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.add),
          tooltip: 'Add new item',
          backgroundColor: Colors.red,
          foregroundColor: Colors.white,
          shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
          ),
          elevation: 20,
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

The FAB is a versatile and powerful widget that can be used to add a primary action to your Flutter app. By using the FAB's props, you can customize its appearance and behavior to match your app's needs.
