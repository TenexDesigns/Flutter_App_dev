In Flutter, a Floating Action Button (FAB) is a prominent and circular button that typically represents the primary action in a screen or view. It's a common UI element used for actions like adding an item, composing a message, or performing a key action within the app. Here's how to use the `FloatingActionButton` widget in Flutter with code samples and some of its key properties:

### Creating a Basic FloatingActionButton:

To create a basic `FloatingActionButton`, you can use the `FloatingActionButton` widget. Here's a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('FAB Example'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Press the FAB!'),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: () {
            // Add your action here
            print('FAB Pressed');
          },
          child: Icon(Icons.add), // Icon displayed on the FAB
          backgroundColor: Colors.blue, // FAB background color
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, we have a simple Flutter app with a `FloatingActionButton`. When the button is pressed, it prints a message to the console.

### Key Properties of FloatingActionButton:

1. **`onPressed` (Function):** This property is required and specifies the function to be executed when the FAB is pressed. It defines the action that occurs when the button is tapped.

2. **`child` (Widget):** The widget to be displayed on the FAB. Typically, an `Icon` or `Text` widget is used to indicate the action.

3. **`backgroundColor` (Color):** Sets the background color of the FAB. You can use any color from the `Colors` class or specify a custom color.

4. **`foregroundColor` (Color):** Sets the color of the icon or text on the FAB. By default, it uses a color based on the theme.

5. **`elevation` (double):** The elevation of the FAB, which determines its shadow. The default value is usually suitable, but you can adjust it if needed.

6. **`heroTag` (Object):** An optional tag used to create a hero animation when navigating between screens. It's necessary if you have multiple FABs on different screens to avoid conflicts.

7. **`tooltip` (String):** An optional tooltip that appears when the user long-presses the FAB. It provides additional information about the button's function.

8. **`shape` (ShapeBorder):** Defines the shape of the FAB. The default is a circle, but you can customize it with various shapes provided by the `ShapeBorder` class.

9. **`isExtended` (bool):** Determines whether the FAB should have an extended width. If set to `true`, it takes up the full width of its parent widget.

10. **`mini` (bool):** If set to `true`, the FAB becomes a mini version with a smaller size.

11. **`clipBehavior` (Clip):** Defines how the FAB should be clipped. The default value is `Clip.none`, but you can use options like `Clip.antiAlias` or `Clip.hardEdge`.

These are some of the key properties you can use to customize the appearance and behavior of a `FloatingActionButton` in Flutter. Depending on your application's needs, you can tailor the FAB to suit your design and functionality requirements.
