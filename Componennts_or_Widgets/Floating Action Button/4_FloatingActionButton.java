The `FloatingActionButton` (FAB) widget in Flutter is a Material Design component that provides a circular icon button that hovers over content to promote a primary action in the application[1]. Here are the steps to use `FloatingActionButton` in Flutter:

1. Create a `FloatingActionButton`: Create a `FloatingActionButton` widget and set its properties, such as the `child`, `onPressed`, and `backgroundColor`.

```
FloatingActionButton(
  child: Icon(Icons.add),
  onPressed: () {
    // Perform some action
  },
  backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
),
```

2. Add the `FloatingActionButton` to a `Scaffold`: Wrap your app content with a `Scaffold` widget and set its `floatingActionButton` property to the `FloatingActionButton` widget.

```
Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(
    title: Text('My App'),
  ),
  body: Center(
    child: Text('Hello, World!'),
  ),
  floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
    child: Icon(Icons.add),
    onPressed: () {
      // Perform some action
    },
    backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
  ),
),
```

By using the `FloatingActionButton` widget in your Flutter app, you can create a circular icon button that hovers over content to promote a primary action in the application. You can customize the `FloatingActionButton` by setting its properties, such as the `child`, `onPressed`, and `backgroundColor`, to fit the needs of your app. 

The `FloatingActionButton` widget has the following properties:

- `child`: The widget to display inside the `FloatingActionButton`.
- `onPressed`: The callback function to call when the `FloatingActionButton` is pressed.
- `backgroundColor`: The background color of the `FloatingActionButton`.
- `foregroundColor`: The foreground color of the `FloatingActionButton`.
- `heroTag`: The tag to use for the hero animation when the `FloatingActionButton` is pressed.
- `elevation`: The elevation of the `FloatingActionButton`.
- `highlightElevation`: The elevation of the `FloatingActionButton` when it is pressed.
- `mini`: Whether the `FloatingActionButton` is a mini button or not.
- `shape`: The shape of the `FloatingActionButton`.
- `clipBehavior`: The clipping behavior of the `FloatingActionButton`.
