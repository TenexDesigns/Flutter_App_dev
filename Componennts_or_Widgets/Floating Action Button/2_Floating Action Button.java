To create a Floating Action Button (FAB) in Flutter, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary Flutter packages:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

2. Add the FAB widget to your layout. The FAB widget is typically placed inside a Scaffold widget as the `floatingActionButton` property. You can customize the appearance of the FAB using its properties. Here are two examples:

- Basic FAB:
```dart
Scaffold(
  floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
    onPressed: () {
      // Add your action here
    },
    child: Icon(Icons.add),
  ),
)
```

- Extended FAB with label:
```dart
Scaffold(
  floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton.extended(
    onPressed: () {
      // Add your action here
    },
    label: Text('Action'),
    icon: Icon(Icons.add),
  ),
)
```

3. Customize the FAB according to your needs. Here are some properties you can use to customize the FAB:

- `onPressed`: A callback function that is called when the FAB is pressed.
- `child`: The widget to display inside the FAB, typically an `Icon` or `Text` widget.
- `backgroundColor`: The background color of the FAB.
- `foregroundColor`: The color of the icon or text inside the FAB.
- `elevation`: The elevation of the FAB, which creates a shadow effect.
- `shape`: The shape of the FAB, such as circular or rectangular.
- `heroTag`: A unique tag for the FAB, used for hero animations.

It's important to follow the Material Design guidelines when using FABs. Some best practices to keep in mind are:

- The FAB should perform the primary action on the screen.
- Avoid using multiple FABs, unless there are two distinct and highly important actions on the screen.
- Place the FAB in the bottom-right corner of the screen by default.
