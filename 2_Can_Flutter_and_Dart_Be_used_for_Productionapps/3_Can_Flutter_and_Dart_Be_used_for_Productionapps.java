Yes, you can make a Twitter clone or Instagram clone with Flutter and Dart. Both tools are able to develop and handle production-level apps.

**Dart**

Dart is a modern programming language that is easy to learn and use. It is also relatively similar to other popular languages such as Java and Kotlin, which can make it easier for Android developers to pick up. Dart is a good language for writing logic, and it is equipped to handle complex tasks.

**Flutter**

Flutter is a cross-platform development framework that allows you to build native-looking apps for Android, iOS, and the web. Flutter uses a widget-based UI system, which is similar to that of Jetpack Compose. This can make it easier to create complex and visually appealing UIs. Flutter also provides a built-in state management system called Provider, which can make it easier to manage the state of your app.

**Ecosystem**

The Flutter ecosystem has a number of tools and libraries that can help you develop production-level apps. Here are a few examples:

* **Making internet calls:** The `package:flutter_webrtc` package allows you to make and receive audio and video calls in Flutter apps.
* **Dependency injection:** The `package:get_it` package is a popular dependency injection library for Flutter.
* **Other tools and libraries:** There are a number of other tools and libraries available for Flutter, including libraries for navigation, authentication, testing, and more.

**Overall, Flutter and Dart are good choices for developing production-level apps. Flutter is a powerful cross-platform development framework, and Dart is a modern programming language that is well-suited for writing logic. The Flutter ecosystem also has a number of tools and libraries that can help you develop production-level apps.**

Here are some additional tips for developing production-level apps with Flutter and Dart:

* Use a state management system such as Provider.
* Test your code thoroughly.
* Use a linter to check your code for potential errors.
* Use a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate your build and deployment process.
* Monitor your app's performance and stability in production.

With careful planning and execution, you can use Flutter and Dart to develop high-quality production-level apps.
