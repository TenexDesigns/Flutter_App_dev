Yes, asynchronous programming is widely used in Flutter app development. Flutter is built on Dart, which supports asynchronous programming using `Future`, `async`, `await`, and `Stream`. These tools are used to manage time-consuming tasks such as file I/O operations, network requests, and database operations, which could otherwise block the app and lead to a poor user experience [Source 10](https://flutter.dev/learn).

**Network Requests**

You can use asynchronous programming to make network requests in your Flutter app. When your app needs to fetch data from a server, you can use the `http` package along with `Future`, `async`, and `await` to perform the network request without blocking the UI. Here's an example:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> fetchData() async {
  var response = await http.get('https://example.com');
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    print('Data fetched successfully');
  } else {
    print('Failed to fetch data');
  }
}
```
In this example, the `fetchData` function is marked as `async`, meaning it is an asynchronous function. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the `http.get` function to complete. This function returns a `Future`, which completes when the data is fetched [Source 0](https://dart.academy/asynchronous-programming-in-dart-and-flutter/).

**FutureBuilder and StreamBuilder**

Flutter provides widgets like `FutureBuilder` and `StreamBuilder` that are designed to simplify the process of working with Futures and Streams. These widgets take a `Future` or `Stream` and a callback function, and automatically rebuild themselves when the `Future` completes or when a new value is emitted from the `Stream`. 

Here's an example of using `FutureBuilder`:

```dart
FutureBuilder<String>(
  future: fetchData(),
  builder: (BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot<String> snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
      return CircularProgressIndicator();
    } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
      return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
    } else {
      return Text('Fetched Data: ${snapshot.data}');
    }
  },
)
```

In this example, `FutureBuilder` takes a `Future` returned by `fetchData` function. It automatically updates its state and the UI based on the result of the Future [Source 5](https://redwerk.com/blog/asynchronous-programming-in-flutter/).

**Error Handling**

When working with asynchronous programming in Flutter, it's important to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of an asynchronous operation. This can be done using `try-catch` blocks or the `catchError` method of the `Future`. Here's an example:

```dart
Future<void> fetchData() async {
  try {
    var response = await http.get('https://example.com');
    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      print('Data fetched successfully');
    } else {
      print('Failed to fetch data');
    }
  } catch (err) {
    print('Caught error: $err');
  }
}
```

In this example, a `try-catch` block is used to catch and handle any errors that may occur while fetching data from the server [Source 6](https://medium.com/@nehatanwar.dev/what-is-async-and-await-in-flutter-17acdcd05b6a).

Remember, using asynchronous programming in your Flutter apps can help create a smoother and more responsive user experience by ensuring that time-consuming operations do not block the UI.
