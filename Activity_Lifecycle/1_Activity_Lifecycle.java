As for app lifecycle, Flutter doesn't have an exact equivalent to Android's Activity lifecycle or iOS's ViewController lifecycle. However, it does have widget lifecycle callbacks that allow you to manage resources. 

For instance, `StatefulWidget` has lifecycle methods like `initState`, `didUpdateWidget`, `dispose`, etc. `initState` is called once when the object is inserted into the tree, `didUpdateWidget` is called whenever the widget configuration changes, and `dispose` is called when the `State` object is removed from the tree permanently [Source 26](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/life-cycle-of-flutter-widgets/).

Flutter also provides an `AppLifecycleState` enum to handle app state changes. The states are `paused`, `resumed`, `inactive`, and `suspending` [Source 17](https://medium.com/gytworkz/deep-dive-into-flutter-app-lifecycle-342b797480aa). 

You can listen to these state changes by adding a `WidgetsBindingObserver` to your `StatefulWidget`:

```dart
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    print('App lifecycle state $state');
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('App Lifecycle Demo'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Home page'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this code, `WidgetsBindingObserver` is being used to listen to the app lifecycle events. The `didChangeAppLifecycleState` method will be called whenever the app lifecycle state changes [Source 25](https://flutteragency.com/handle-app-lifecycle-in-flutter-app/).

In conclusion, `BuildContext` and app lifecycle are important concepts in Flutter. Understanding them can help you build more efficient and responsive apps.
