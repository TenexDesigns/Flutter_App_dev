Both implementations you've provided are valid ways to use GetX for state management in Flutter. They achieve the same goal of managing and displaying a counter value, but they use slightly different syntax and widgets.

1. **Implementation with `GetX<CounterController>` and `builder`:

   ```dart
   GetX<CounterController>(
     builder: (controller) {
       return Text(
         'Count: ${counterController.counter.value}',
         style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
       );
     },
   )
   ```

   This implementation uses the `GetX` widget with a builder function. It explicitly defines which part of the UI depends on the `CounterController` and updates only that part when the `counter` value changes.

2. **Implementation with `Obx`:

   ```dart
   Obx(() => Text('Count: ${counterController.count}'))
   ```

   This implementation uses the `Obx` widget, which is a simplified way to observe and react to changes in a reactive variable. It automatically rebuilds the widget whenever the `count` variable changes.

Both implementations are valid and functional. The choice between them depends on your preference and how you want to structure your code:

- If you prefer a more explicit approach where you specify which part of the UI depends on specific variables, the first implementation with `GetX<CounterController>` and `builder` is a good choice.

- If you prefer a more concise and reactive approach, the second implementation with `Obx` is simpler and can be more convenient for small to medium-sized projects.

In general, `Obx` is often used for simplicity and conciseness, while `GetX` with `builder` provides more fine-grained control over updates. You can choose the one that best fits your coding style and project requirements. Both are considered proper implementations of state management using GetX in Flutter.
