In the code sample I provided for using GetX, `GetMaterialApp` is a widget that comes from the GetX package (`get`). It's a replacement for Flutter's `MaterialApp` widget and is designed to work seamlessly with GetX's navigation and state management features.

Here's the relevant part of the code where `GetMaterialApp` is used:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(GetMaterialApp(
    title: 'GetX Navigation Example',
    initialRoute: '/home',
    getPages: [
      GetPage(name: '/home', page: () => HomePage()),
      GetPage(name: '/details', page: () => DetailsPage()),
    ],
  ));
}
```

In this code:

- `GetMaterialApp` is used as the root widget for your Flutter application instead of `MaterialApp`.

- `title` specifies the title of your app.

- `initialRoute` specifies the initial route that the app should navigate to when it starts.

- `getPages` is a list of named routes along with the associated page widgets. It defines the routes that can be used for navigation.

By using `GetMaterialApp`, you enable GetX to handle routing and navigation efficiently. It also sets up the necessary context for GetX's features, such as state management and dependency injection, to work seamlessly throughout your app.
