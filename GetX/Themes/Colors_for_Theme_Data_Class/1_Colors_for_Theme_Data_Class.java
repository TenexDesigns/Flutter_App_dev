The `ThemeData` class in Flutter provides a comprehensive set of properties to customize the colors and styles of your app's theme. Here are some of the properties you can customize:

- `Color primaryColor`: The primary color to use in your app. This color is often used for interactive elements and app bars.

- `Color accentColor`: The color to use for interactive elements and call-to-action items.

- `Color buttonColor`: The color to use for buttons.

- `TextTheme textTheme`: The text styles to use for various text elements in your app.

- `ColorScheme colorScheme`: Defines a single set of colors that can be used to configure a number of different visual components.

- `AppBarTheme appBarTheme`: The theme to use for app bars.

- `FloatingActionButtonThemeData floatingActionButtonTheme`: The theme to use for floating action buttons.

- `IconThemeData iconTheme`: The theme to use for icons.

- `SliderThemeData sliderTheme`: The theme to use for sliders.

- `TabBarTheme tabBarTheme`: The theme to use for tab bars.

- `CardTheme cardTheme`: The theme to use for cards.

- `ChipThemeData chipTheme`: The theme to use for chips.

- `DialogTheme dialogTheme`: The theme to use for dialogs.

- `PopupMenuThemeData popupMenuTheme`: The theme to use for popup menus.

- `ButtonThemeData buttonTheme`: The theme to use for buttons.

Here's an example of how you can customize some of these properties:

```dart
final ThemeData myTheme = ThemeData(
  primaryColor: Colors.blue,
  accentColor: Colors.amber,
  buttonColor: Colors.red,
  textTheme: TextTheme(
    bodyText1: TextStyle(color: Colors.purple),
    bodyText2: TextStyle(color: Colors.green),
  ),
  appBarTheme: AppBarTheme(
    color: Colors.orange,
    textTheme: TextTheme(
      headline6: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20),
    ),
  ),
  floatingActionButtonTheme: FloatingActionButtonThemeData(
    backgroundColor: Colors.yellow,
  ),
);
```

In this example, the app has a primary color of blue, an accent color of amber, a button color of red, and custom text colors. The app bar has a color of orange and a custom text style. The floating action button has a background color of yellow.
