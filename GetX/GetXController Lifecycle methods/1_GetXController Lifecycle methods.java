In GetX, the `GetxController` class provides several lifecycle methods that you can override to perform specific actions at different stages of the controller's lifecycle. Here are the lifecycle methods available in GetXController:

1. `onInit()`: This method is called when the controller is first initialized. It is typically used to initialize variables or perform any setup tasks required for the controller.

2. `onReady()`: This method is called after the widget is rendered and the controller is ready to start interacting with other widgets or services. It is often used to fetch data from APIs or perform any asynchronous initialization tasks.

3. `onClose()`: This method is called when the controller is removed from memory. It is used to clean up resources, cancel subscriptions, or perform any necessary cleanup tasks to prevent memory leaks.

4. `onStart()`: This method is called when the controller is first registered with GetX. It is useful for performing any tasks that need to be done before the controller is fully initialized.

5. `onStop()`: This method is called when the controller is unregistered from GetX. It can be used to perform any cleanup tasks or stop any ongoing processes before the controller is removed.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of these lifecycle methods:

```dart
class MyController extends GetxController {
  @override
  void onInit() {
    super.onInit();
    // Perform initialization tasks
    print('Controller initialized');
  }

  @override
  void onReady() {
    super.onReady();
    // Perform tasks after the widget is rendered
    print('Controller ready');
  }

  @override
  void onClose() {
    // Perform cleanup tasks
    print('Controller closed');
    super.onClose();
  }

  @override
  void onStart() {
    super.onStart();
    // Perform tasks before the controller is fully initialized
    print('Controller started');
  }

  @override
  void onStop() {
    // Perform tasks before the controller is removed
    print('Controller stopped');
    super.onStop();
  }
}
```

In this example, the `MyController` class extends `GetxController` and overrides the lifecycle methods. Each method is called at the corresponding stage of the controller's lifecycle, and you can perform any necessary actions within each method.

It's important to note that the `onInit()` and `onClose()` methods are the most commonly used lifecycle methods. The `onReady()`, `onStart()`, and `onStop()` methods are less frequently used but can be useful in specific scenarios.

By overriding these lifecycle methods, you can control the behavior of your GetX controllers and perform actions at specific stages of their lifecycle. This allows you to manage resources efficiently and ensure proper initialization and cleanup of your controller's state.
