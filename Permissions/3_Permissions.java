```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  permission_handler: ^8.1.6
```

2. **Import the `permission_handler` package in your Dart file**:

```dart
import 'package:permission_handler/permission_handler.dart';
```

3. **Check a permission**:

You can check if a permission is granted using the `checkPermissionStatus` method:

```dart
var status = await Permission.camera.status;
if (status.isGranted) {
  // permission is granted
} else if (status.isDenied) {
  // permission is denied
}
```

In this example, `Permission.camera.status` is used to check the status of the camera permission.

4. **Request a permission**:

You can request a permission using the `request` method:

```dart
if (await Permission.camera.request().isGranted) {
  // permission is granted
}
```

In this example, `Permission.camera.request()` is used to request the camera permission.

5. **Request multiple permissions**:

You can request multiple permissions at once using the `request` method:

```dart
Map<Permission, PermissionStatus> statuses = await [
  Permission.camera,
  Permission.microphone,
].request();
```

In this example, `Permission.camera` and `Permission.microphone` are requested at the same time.

6. **Open the app settings**:

If a permission is permanently denied, you can open the app settings so the user can enable the permission:

```dart
if (await Permission.camera.isPermanentlyDenied) {
  // The user opted to never again see the permission request dialog for this
  // app. The only way to change the permission's status now is to let the
  // user manually enable it in the system settings.
  openAppSettings();
}
```

In this example, `Permission.camera.isPermanentlyDenied` is used to check if the camera permission is permanently denied, and `openAppSettings` is used to open the app settings.

Remember to always check the permission status before using a feature that requires that permission. If the permission is not granted, you should request it or guide the user to enable it in the system settings.
