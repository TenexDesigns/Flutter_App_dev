In Flutter, the default flex factor for a widget placed inside a `Flex` or `Flex`-related container like `Row`, `Column`, or `Expanded` is 1. This means that by default, each widget inside a `Flex` container occupies an equal portion of the available space.

Let's consider an example where you have a red container (50x50) wrapped in another container:

```dart
Container(
  color: Colors.blue,
  child: Container(
    color: Colors.red,
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
  ),
)
```

In this example, the outer blue container doesn't have any specific width or height set, so it will take up all the available space in its parent, which may depend on the layout of your Flutter app.

The inner red container, on the other hand, has a fixed width and height of 50x50. Since there's no `Flex` involved in this particular code snippet, the red container will retain its fixed size and be centered within the blue container.

If you were to wrap the inner red container with an `Expanded` widget inside a `Column` or `Row`, for example, the default flex factor for the `Expanded` would be 1, and it would occupy an equal portion of the available space within the parent `Column` or `Row`.

Here's an example of the same containers with an `Expanded` widget:

```dart
Container(
  color: Colors.blue,
  child: Column(
    children: [
      Expanded(
        child: Container(
          color: Colors.red,
          width: 50,
          height: 50,
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
)
```

In this case, the `Expanded` widget would occupy all available vertical space within the blue container, and the red container would take up that space while maintaining its fixed width of 50. The flex factor of 1 means it gets an equal share of the available space.

The behavior of these containers may change based on their context within your app's layout, so it's essential to consider the overall structure of your UI when designing Flutter layouts.
