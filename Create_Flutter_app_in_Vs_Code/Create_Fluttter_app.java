To create a new Flutter app, you can use the following command:

```
flutter create <project_name>
```

This will create a new Flutter project in the current directory.

You can also specify the platform that you want to create your app for using the `--platforms` option. For example, to create an app for Android and iOS, you would use the following command:

```
flutter create <project_name> --platforms android,ios
```

Once you have created your project, you can build and run it using the following commands:

```
flutter build
flutter run
```

This will build your app and run it on the connected device or emulator.

You can also use the `flutter doctor` command to check that your system is properly configured for Flutter development.

Here is an example of how to create a new Flutter app and run it on an Android device:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
2. Run the following command:

```
flutter create my_app
```

3. Wait for the project to be created.
4. Connect your Android device to your computer.
5. Run the following command:

```
flutter run
```

This will build your app and run it on your Android device.

If you are new to Flutter, I recommend that you read the Flutter documentation to learn more about how to get started.
