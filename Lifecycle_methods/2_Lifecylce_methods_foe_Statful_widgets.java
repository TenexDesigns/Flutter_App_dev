The `onInit()` method is not exclusive to Stateful Widgets, but it is the most common place to initialize state in a Stateful Widget. The `onInit()` method is called once, immediately after the widget is inserted into the tree.

The `onInit()` method is also present in other widgets, such as the `FutureBuilder` widget. The `FutureBuilder` widget uses the `onInit()` method to initialize its state and start listening for changes to the Future.

Here is a list of widgets that have lifecycle methods:

* Stateful Widgets
* FutureBuilder
* ChangeNotifierProvider
* Consumer
* StreamBuilder
* AnimatedBuilder

The lifecycle methods of these widgets are called at different points during the widget's lifetime. For example, the `initState()` method is called once, immediately after the widget is inserted into the tree, while the `dispose()` method is called once, just before the widget is removed from the tree.

The lifecycle methods of these widgets can be used to initialize state, start and stop listening for changes to data, and perform cleanup tasks.

For example, the following code shows how to use the `onInit()` method to initialize state in a Stateful Widget:

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<MyWidget> createState() => _MyWidgetState();
}

class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  int counter = 0;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    // Initialize state here.
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text('The counter is $counter.');
  }
}
```

In this example, the `counter` state variable is initialized in the `initState()` method. This ensures that the `counter` state variable is initialized before the widget is built.

The lifecycle methods of widgets can be used to write efficient and maintainable Flutter code. By understanding the lifecycle methods of widgets, you can avoid common mistakes, such as accessing uninitialized state or performing cleanup tasks too late.
