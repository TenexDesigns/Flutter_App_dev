I apologize for the confusion, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. In Flutter, there's no `onInit` method. However, there are lifecycle methods for stateful widgets. These methods are part of the `State` object, not the `StatefulWidget` itself. 

Here are the lifecycle methods for a `State` object in Flutter:

1. `initState()`: This is the first method called when the widget is created (after the constructor, of course.) This is where you should put initialization code.

2. `didChangeDependencies()`: This method is called immediately after `initState` the first time the widget is built. If the `BuildContext` for this `State` object changes (e.g. if the widget is inserted into a different part of the tree), this method is called again.

3. `build()`: This method is called in each `State` object's lifecycle. It describes the part of the user interface represented by the widget. It's called every time the UI needs to be rendered, which could be as often as every single frame.

4. `didUpdateWidget(Widget oldWidget)`: If the parent widget changes and has to rebuild this widget (because it needs to give it different configuration information, for example), this method is called.

5. `deactivate()`: This method is called when this `State` object is removed from the tree.

6. `dispose()`: This method is called when this `State` object will never build again. After the framework calls `dispose`, the `State` object is considered unmounted and the `mounted` property is false.

These lifecycle methods are only available in `StatefulWidget` and its `State` because `StatelessWidget` doesn't have a state that could change over time, so it doesn't have a lifecycle beyond the execution of the `build` method.

I hope this clarifies things for you. Let me know if you have any other questions!
