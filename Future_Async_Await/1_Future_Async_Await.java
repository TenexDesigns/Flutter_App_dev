In Flutter and Dart, asynchronous programming is crucial for handling tasks like network requests, file I/O, and other operations that may take time to complete without blocking the user interface. Asynchronous programming in Dart revolves around the `Future` class and `async` and `await` keywords. Let's break down each of these concepts:

1. **Future**:
   - A `Future` represents a potential value or error that will be available at some time in the future. It's used to handle asynchronous operations.
   - When you call an asynchronous function, it typically returns a `Future` immediately. The actual result may not be available at that moment.
   - A `Future` can be in one of three states: uncompleted (waiting for a result), completed with a value, or completed with an error.
   - To work with the result of a `Future`, you can use `then()`, `catchError()`, or `await`.

2. **async**:
   - The `async` keyword is used to mark a function as asynchronous. This allows you to use the `await` keyword inside the function.
   - When a function is marked as `async`, it can pause and resume its execution without blocking the entire application. It's particularly useful for waiting on `Future` results without freezing the UI.

3. **await**:
   - The `await` keyword is used inside an `async` function to pause the execution until a `Future` is completed. It can only be used inside an `async` function.
   - When you use `await`, you'll get the result or error of the `Future`. This makes the code read more synchronously, as if it were blocking, even though it's not.

Here's an example of using `Future`, `async`, and `await`:

```dart
Future<void> fetchUserData() async {
  try {
    // Simulate a network request that returns user data after 2 seconds.
    final userData = await fetchUserFromServer();
    print('User data: $userData');
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e');
  }
}

Future<String> fetchUserFromServer() {
  return Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2), () {
    // Simulate fetching data from a server.
    // For simplicity, we return a string here.
    return 'John Doe';
  });
}
```

In this example:

- `fetchUserData` is an asynchronous function marked with `async`.
- `fetchUserFromServer` returns a `Future<String>` representing the user data.
- Inside `fetchUserData`, we use `await` to wait for the result of `fetchUserFromServer`.
- If the `Future` is successful, the result is printed. If it throws an error, the error is caught in the `catch` block.

Some commonly used methods and properties associated with `Future` include:

- `then`: Attach a callback function to execute when the `Future` completes successfully.
- `catchError`: Attach a callback function to handle errors if the `Future` fails.
- `whenComplete`: Execute a callback when the `Future` is completed, regardless of success or failure.
- `timeout`: Specify a duration after which the `Future` is considered as failed if it hasn't completed.
- `isCompleted`: Checks if the `Future` is completed.
- `isCanceled`: Checks if the `Future` has been canceled.

These methods allow you to handle the results of asynchronous operations effectively.
