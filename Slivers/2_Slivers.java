In Flutter, "slivers" are a fundamental building block for creating scrollable areas with custom layouts and behaviors. Slivers are used within a `CustomScrollView` and provide more flexibility and control over how content is displayed and laid out within a scrollable view. They can be used to create various complex scrolling effects and layouts.

Here are some common types of slivers and how they can be used:

1. **SliverAppBar**:
   - The `SliverAppBar` is used to create an app bar that can expand and collapse as you scroll.
   - It's often used at the top of a scroll view, and it can change its size, title, and actions as you scroll.

   Example of a basic `SliverAppBar`:

   ```dart
   SliverAppBar(
     expandedHeight: 200.0,
     flexibleSpace: FlexibleSpaceBar(
       title: Text('SliverAppBar Example'),
       background: Image.network('image_url_here'),
     ),
   )
   ```

2. **SliverList**:
   - `SliverList` creates a scrollable list of items. It is particularly useful when you want to create a list of items in a custom layout with a `CustomScrollView`.

   Example of `SliverList`:

   ```dart
   SliverList(
     delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
       (BuildContext context, int index) {
         return ListTile(
           title: Text('Item $index'),
         );
       },
       childCount: 20, // The number of items in the list
     ),
   )
   ```

3. **SliverGrid**:
   - `SliverGrid` is used to create a scrollable grid of items.
   - It allows you to display items in a grid layout, and you can customize the cross-axis and main-axis spacing.

   Example of `SliverGrid`:

   ```dart
   SliverGrid(
     gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
       crossAxisCount: 3,
       crossAxisSpacing: 8.0,
       mainAxisSpacing: 8.0,
     ),
     delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate(
       (BuildContext context, int index) {
         return Card(
           child: Text('Grid Item $index'),
         );
       },
       childCount: 12, // The number of grid items
     ),
   )
   ```

4. **SliverToBoxAdapter**:
   - `SliverToBoxAdapter` is used to insert a non-scrollable widget within a `CustomScrollView`.
   - It's useful for adding non-scrollable elements, such as headers, footers, or banners, to your scrollable content.

   Example of `SliverToBoxAdapter`:

   ```dart
   SliverToBoxAdapter(
     child: Container(
       height: 100.0,
       color: Colors.blue,
       alignment: Alignment.center,
       child: Text('Non-scrollable Header'),
     ),
   )
   ```

5. **SliverFillRemaining**:
   - `SliverFillRemaining` is used to make a widget fill the remaining space in the viewport.
   - It's often used to ensure that content fills the available space in a scroll view when other slivers are present.

   Example of `SliverFillRemaining`:

   ```dart
   SliverFillRemaining(
     child: Container(
       color: Colors.green,
       alignment: Alignment.center,
       child: Text('Fill Remaining Space'),
     ),
   )
   ```

These are some of the commonly used slivers in Flutter. You can use them within a `CustomScrollView` to create custom scrolling layouts for your app. Slivers provide a powerful way to build complex and responsive scrollable views.
