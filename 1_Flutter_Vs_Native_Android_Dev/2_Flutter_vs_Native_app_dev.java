Your consideration of switching from native Android development (Kotlin and Jetpack Compose) to Flutter is a common one, and there are several factors to consider. Whether Flutter is better for you depends on your specific needs and preferences. Here are some points to consider:

**Advantages of Flutter:**

1. **Single Codebase:** One of Flutter's biggest advantages is that you can write a single codebase for both Android and iOS apps. This reduces development time and effort compared to maintaining separate codebases for each platform.

2. **Hot Reload:** Flutter's hot reload feature allows you to see changes in your app almost instantly, making the development process faster and more interactive.

3. **Rich UI:** Flutter provides a wide range of customizable widgets and a powerful UI framework, which can help you create visually appealing and consistent user interfaces. The declarative UI approach in Flutter is similar to Jetpack Compose.

4. **Strong Community:** Flutter has a growing and active community, which means you can find a wealth of resources, packages, and plugins to accelerate your development.

5. **Performance:** Flutter's performance is impressive, and it's often on par with native apps. The Flutter team has made efforts to optimize app performance, and it leverages hardware acceleration for UI rendering.

6. **Access to Native Features:** Flutter provides plugins that allow you to access native features and APIs, so you're not limited in terms of functionality.

7. **Ease of Learning:** If you are already familiar with Dart (Flutter's programming language), transitioning to Flutter can be relatively smooth.

**Considerations:**

1. **Access to Native APIs:** While Flutter provides access to native features, there may be a slight delay in adopting new native APIs compared to native development.

2. **App Size:** Flutter apps tend to have a larger file size compared to native apps due to the inclusion of the Flutter engine. However, this difference is becoming less significant as Flutter evolves.

3. **Community and Ecosystem:** While Flutter's community is growing rapidly, it may not be as mature as the native Android community, which has a longer history and a vast ecosystem.

4. **Platform-Specific Design:** Flutter's UI components may not always perfectly match the platform-specific design guidelines. You might need to invest extra effort to achieve a truly native look and feel.

5. **Team Expertise:** If your team is already experienced in Kotlin and native Android development, transitioning to Flutter might require some retraining and adjustment.

Ultimately, the choice between Flutter and native Android development depends on your specific project requirements, team expertise, and development goals. If you believe that Flutter's advantages align with your project needs and that it will help you overcome the obstacles and complexities you've faced with native development, then it could be a good choice for your next project. Remember that both Flutter and native development have their strengths, and the best choice depends on your context and priorities.
