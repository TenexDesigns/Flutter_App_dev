Whether Flutter is better than native Android in terms of developer experience depends on your personal preferences and the specific needs of your project. However, here are some general advantages and disadvantages of Flutter to consider:

**Advantages of Flutter:**

* **Cross-platform development:** Flutter allows you to develop a single codebase for both Android and iOS apps, which can save time and money.
* **Hot reload:** Flutter's hot reload feature allows you to see your changes reflected in the app immediately, without having to restart the app. This can significantly speed up your development workflow.
* **Dart:** Dart is a modern programming language that is easy to learn and use. It is also relatively similar to other popular languages such as Java and Kotlin, which can make it easier for Android developers to pick up.
* **Large community:** Flutter has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the framework and provide support to other users.

**Disadvantages of Flutter:**

* **Maturity:** Flutter is a relatively new framework, and it is still under development. This means that there may be some bugs or missing features.
* **Size:** Flutter apps can be larger than native Android apps due to the inclusion of the Flutter framework.
* **Performance:** Flutter apps may not perform as well as native Android apps in some cases.

**Specific advantages of Flutter over native Android:**

* **Widget-based UI:** Flutter uses a widget-based UI system, which is similar to that of Jetpack Compose. This can make it easier to create complex and visually appealing UIs.
* **Declarative programming:** Flutter uses a declarative programming style, which can make your code more readable and maintainable.
* **State management:** Flutter provides a built-in state management system called Provider, which can make it easier to manage the state of your app.

**Overall, Flutter is a good choice for developers who want to build cross-platform apps or who want to use a more modern and declarative programming style. However, it is important to be aware of the potential disadvantages of Flutter, such as its maturity and size.**

To answer your specific questions:

* **Is the design of app UI and handling of app logic easier in Flutter than in native Android Kotlin and Jetpack Compose?**

This is a matter of personal preference. Some developers find Flutter's widget-based UI system and declarative programming style to be easier to use than native Android development. Others find that native Android development gives them more control over the UI and performance of their apps.

* **What features does Flutter offer that are beneficial and make it better compared to native Android?**

In addition to the advantages listed above, Flutter also offers a number of other features that can be beneficial for developers, such as:

    * A rich set of pre-built widgets for common UI elements
    * Support for native gestures and animations
    * A powerful development environment with tools for debugging, testing, and deployment
    * A large and active community of developers who contribute to the framework and provide support to other users

**Is your thought process correct or is it flawed?**

Your thought process is correct. The user does not care what technology is used to develop an app, as long as it works well. However, there are some potential advantages to using Flutter over native Android, such as the ease of development, the cross-platform support, and the large community of developers.

Ultimately, the best way to decide whether to use Flutter or native Android is to consider the specific needs of your project and your own preferences.
