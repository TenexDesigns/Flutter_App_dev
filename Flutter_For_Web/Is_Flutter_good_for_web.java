The article you linked highlights the following key points about Flutter for web development:

* Flutter for web is still in its infancy and is not yet recommended for production use.
* Flutter for web has the potential to be a powerful tool for web development, but it also has some limitations.
* One of the biggest challenges for Flutter for web is ensuring consistency across different browsers.
* Another challenge for Flutter for web is performance. Canvas rendering is not as performant as writing HTML manually.
* Overall, the article concludes that Flutter for web has the potential to be a good choice for certain types of web applications, but it is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before using it in production.

The article also mentions how Google Ads and Alibaba use Flutter for web. Google Ads uses Flutter to build its web interface, and Alibaba uses Flutter to build its e-commerce website and other web applications.

Here are some additional thoughts on the use of Flutter for web development:

* Flutter for web is still under development, but it is improving rapidly. Google is committed to making Flutter for web a viable production platform.
* Flutter for web is a good choice for web applications that need to be high-performance and visually appealing.
* Flutter for web is also a good choice for web applications that need to be cross-platform.
* However, it is important to keep in mind the limitations of Flutter for web, such as the potential for consistency issues and performance issues.

Overall, Flutter for web is a promising platform, but it is important to carefully consider your needs before using it in production.

The article you provided discusses Flutter for the web, its features, and its challenges. Here are some key takeaways:

1. **Flutter for Web Introduction:** Flutter is primarily a mobile app development SDK, but Google introduced Flutter for Web to enable developers to use Flutter for web development as well.

2. **Code Compatibility:** The goal of Flutter for Web is to solve the problem of code compatibility between different platforms, such as iOS, Android, and the web.

3. **Dart to JavaScript Compilation:** While both mobile Flutter and Flutter for Web share the Dart language at their core, Flutter for Web compiles Dart code into JavaScript. Some parts of the user interface are converted into standard HTML tags, while others are rendered using Canvas, forming a DOM tree.

4. **Challenges with Consistency:** Achieving the same level of consistency with Flutter for Web as with Flutter for mobile requires extensive rendering with Canvas. However, using Canvas for rendering may not perform as optimally as using HTML tags, especially on mobile devices. Balancing performance and consistency is a challenge.

5. **Performance Considerations:** Flutter for Web components may have animations and visuals with Material Design (MD) characteristics, which require better performance than standard HTML tags. Additionally, the conversion of Dart DSLs to a DOM tree is complex and may not be simpler than manually writing a DOM tree.

6. **Event Handling:** Flutter for Web handles the capture and distribution of gesture events for controls that use Canvas, which is implemented by the Flutter for Web framework itself.

7. **Limited HTML Tag Reuse:** To achieve a balance between consistency and performance, Flutter for Web reuses only a limited number of standard HTML tags. These tags should have simple and intuitive functions and should ideally not have complex graphical display requirements.

8. **Ecosystem Challenges:** Flutter's decision to create a new ecosystem separate from the web ecosystem has led to challenges in code reuse and solutions accumulated in the web technology stack.

9. **Integration with Web Ecosystem:** While there's interest in integrating Flutter with the web ecosystem to benefit from its efficiency and code reuse, there are also concerns about potential challenges and whether it's a good idea.

10. **Alibaba's Use of Flutter:** The article briefly mentions Alibaba's involvement with Flutter and its efforts to connect Flutter with the web ecosystem. It discusses the advantages of Flutter, especially its cross-platform capabilities.

In summary, Flutter for Web is an extension of Flutter that allows developers to build web applications using the same codebase as mobile apps. However, achieving consistency and performance can be challenging, and there are discussions about whether it's the best approach for web development. Alibaba is mentioned as a company exploring Flutter's capabilities, especially in connecting Flutter with the web ecosystem to leverage its advantages.
