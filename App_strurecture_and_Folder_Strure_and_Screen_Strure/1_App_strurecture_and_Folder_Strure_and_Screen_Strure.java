The recommended way to structure your Flutter app is to use a feature-based approach. This means that you should group your code into features, which are self-contained units of functionality. Each feature should have its own folder, which should contain all of the code for that feature, including its widgets, models, and services.

For the layout of your app, you should use the `Scaffold` widget. The `Scaffold` widget provides a basic layout for your app, including a top app bar, a bottom app bar, and a body. You can then add your own widgets to the body of the `Scaffold` widget to create your app's UI.

In the example code that you provided, the `BookList` widget is being used as the body of the `Scaffold` widget. This means that the `BookList` widget is responsible for rendering the UI for the list of books.

If you have components that are constant across screens, such as a bottom app bar, you can create a reusable widget for that component. You can then add that widget to the body of the `Scaffold` widget on each screen where it is needed.

To create a reusable widget, you simply need to create a new class that extends the `Widget` class. You can then add your code for the widget to the `build()` method.

For example, the following code shows a reusable widget for a bottom app bar:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class BottomAppBarWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return BottomAppBar(
      items: <BottomNavigationBarItem>[
        BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: 'Home'),
        BottomNavigationBarItem(icon: Icon(Icons.settings), label: 'Settings'),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

To use this widget, you can simply add it to the body of the `Scaffold` widget on each screen where you want to display it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'bottom_app_bar_widget.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text('My App')),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, world!'),
        ),
        bottomNavigationBar: BottomAppBarWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This will display the bottom app bar on all screens in your app.

**Recommended folder structure**

The recommended folder structure for a Flutter app is as follows:

```
lib/
├── assets/
│   └── images/
├── components/
│   └── bottom_app_bar_widget.dart
├── models/
│   └── book.dart
├── screens/
│   └── book_list.dart
├── services/
│   └── book_service.dart
└── main.dart
```

This structure groups the code for each feature into its own folder. It also makes it easy to find and manage specific types of code, such as images, components, models, and screens.

**UI design**

To design the UI for your Flutter app, you can use the Flutter Inspector. The Flutter Inspector is a tool that allows you to inspect the UI of your app and make changes to it in real time.

To use the Flutter Inspector, simply run your app in debug mode and then open the Flutter Inspector window. You can then select any widget in your app and view its properties. You can also make changes to the properties of the widget and see the changes reflected in the app's UI.
